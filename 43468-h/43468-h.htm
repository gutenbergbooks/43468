<h2 id="INTRODUCTION"><a id="Page_3" class="pagenum" title="3"> </a>
INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Several years ago as I was leaving Washington after giving
a course of demonstration lectures in hygienic cookery, I was
impressed with the thought that a cook book (which my friends
had been urging me to write) giving the results of my experience,
would be the means of reaching the greatest number of people
with knowledge on health subjects.</p>

<p>As a result of that thought, this book comes with earnest,
heartfelt greeting to all other works of the same nature, not as
a rival but as a co-worker in the great plan of glorifying our
Creator. 1 Cor. 10:31.</p>

<p>In its preparation, I have purposed to make the book practical,
avoiding technicalities and to some extent conventionalities,
and have endeavored to “meet the people where they are” by
not being extreme or radical; and at the same time to make
principles of truth so clear that many will be won from “the indulgence
of appetite, which places them in such a condition of
health that there is a constant warring against the soul’s highest
interests.”</p>

<p>While there are recipes especially for those who entertain,
there is an abundant variety of directions for carefully prepared
simple dishes.</p>

<p>The explicit general directions will not be needed by all, but
from my twenty years of experience in teaching, I know that
many will value them.</p>

<p>The foods richest in proteids are classed as “True Meats” and
no flesh meat names are used in the book.</p>

<p><a id="Page_4" class="pagenum" title="4"> </a>
This collection contains the choicest of those of my recipes
which have been published by others in various books and periodicals
at different times.</p>

<p>I am indebted to an innumerable company of people of all
classes for <em>ideas</em>, for which I would be glad to thank each one
personally if it were possible.</p>

<p>Though there is hardly any choice, the recipes marked with a
star are especially practical and desirable.</p>

<p>All unnamed quotations are from “The Ministry of Healing”
or other works by the same author.</p>

<p>That “The Laurel Health Cookery” may bring rich blessings
to many households is my earnest prayer.</p>

GENERAL</h2>


<h3 id="COOKING_UTENSILS">COOKING UTENSILS, THEIR USES AND CARE</h3>

<p>“A good housekeeper without perfected kitchen conveniences
is as much of an anomaly as a carpenter without a plane, a
dressmaker without a sewing machine.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">Anonym.</i></p>

<p>What would we think of the farmer who to-day was cutting
his hay with a scythe and reaping his grain with a cradle because
he could not “afford” a reaper and mower?</p>

<p>While we should be able to adapt ourselves to circumstances,
to improvise double boilers, steamers and ovens when necessary,
it is at the same time true economy to have an abundance of
cooking utensils if possible. A half dozen saucepans will last six
times as long as one used for everything and save much valuable
time.</p>

<p>“To many people, anything out of the usual custom is deemed
extravagant.” This I suppose accounts for the fact that many
housewives who have beautifully furnished parlors and wear
fine clothing cannot afford conveniences for the kitchen.</p>

<p>The room in which is prepared the “food to sustain life and
nourish brain, bone and muscle,” should be the most attractive
place in the house, and it will be when arranged and furnished
for convenience. I can think of nothing more interesting than
a kitchen with the frequently used utensils decorating the walls
where they can be reached with few steps; and such little things
as spoons, egg beaters, can openers, spatulas, cork screws, potato
mashers, measuring cups, funnels, soup dippers, wire strainers,
pinchers and skimmers, not forgetting a small cushion with
pins, hanging just over the table; the table having drawers for
knives, vegetable cutters and other unhangable articles.</p>

<p>The best quality of aluminum ware is the cheapest and best
for fruits and for general cooking purposes, except for vegetables.</p>

<p><a id="Page_10" class="pagenum" title="10"> </a>
Never put lye or anything alkaline into aluminum vessels.</p>

<p>Copper and re-tinned vessels are unequaled in some respects
(if they may not be used for acid foods); being flat bottomed,
thick and heavy, milk, legumes, cereals and foods of that nature
are not so apt to stick or scorch in them, and they are almost
everlasting. They can be re-tinned when the lining wears off.</p>

<p>Iron kettles and frying pans are excellent for many things.
Some of the uses of a nice smooth iron frying pan are to bake a
round cake or a thick pie or a pudding in, to scallop corn or potatoes,
or to scald milk.</p>

<p>Use granite, agate, and porcelain lined utensils with care.</p>

<p>Never dry them on the stove as that causes them to crack; and
do not knock the edges of the kettles and saucepans with a
spoon, nor strike any kind of a vessel with an agate spoon, as
it causes the little particles of glazing to flake off. These
flakes from agate utensils often work serious injury to the delicate
membranes of the digestive tract.</p>

<p>One large double boiler holding from 8 to 16 qts. is very desirable
as it furnishes two kettles for fruit canning and other
purposes and can be used as a double boiler when required.
Several smaller ones of different sizes economize time and food
material.</p>

<p>To improvise a double boiler, set a close covered pan over a
kettle of boiling water; or set a covered dish into a pail with
water in it, cover and put into the oven; or put a pan or other
covered vessel into a kettle of water on top of the stove with
something under it to keep it from the bottom of the kettle;
or set one milk crock into another, with water in the lower
one; or a bowl into the top of the teakettle. The first double
boiler I ever owned was a gluepot.</p>

<p>Use wire strainers or small and large colanders, well covered,
over dishes of boiling water, for steamers; and when a deeper receptacle
<a id="Page_11" class="pagenum" title="11"> </a>
is required, turn a basin or pan that just fits, over the
top.</p>

<p>Two sizes of flat colanders with pin head holes are to be found
at the 5 and 10 cent stores, which are just as useful and durable
as more expensive ones. They answer the purpose of both
steamer and colander.</p>

<p>Be sure to have deep kettles or boilers into which the colanders
fit perfectly. I have been in kitchens where, though there
was a sufficient variety of utensils, they were of little use, for no
two things fitted; the steamers and colanders were just a little
too large or a little too small for all the kettles, requiring double
the expenditure of time and strength in using.<!--TN: added period--></p>

<p>Iron rings from small wooden kegs or little rings melted from
the tops of tin cans are great treasures to use on the top of the
stove, in kettles, or in the oven, to set vessels on to keep the
contents from sticking and burning.</p>

<p>“Gunboats”&mdash;empty tin cans&mdash;of all sizes, have a great variety
of uses.</p>

<p>A book of asbestos sheets costing ten cents is invaluable.
Each sheet can be used again and again for laying over bread,
cake and other foods in the oven.</p>

<p>After using an aluminum frying or omelet pan for a time, one
would always feel it to be a necessity.</p>

<p>The uses of timbale molds and custard cups are almost innumerable,
and when you once get them you have them.</p>

<p>A pastry brush saves greasy fingers and much time, in oiling
cold or warm pans. Never use it on a <em>hot</em> griddle.</p>

<p>For dispatch and thoroughness in oiling round bottomed gem
pans, nothing equals a piece of cloth folded in several thicknesses
2½ to 3 in. square, saturated with oil.</p>

<p>A spatula (similar to a palette knife) of medium size will soon
pay for itself in the material it saves from the sides of the pans,
as well as in time.</p>

<p><a id="Page_12" class="pagenum" title="12"> </a>
A large French knife chops vegetables on a board more rapidly
than they can be done in a chopping bowl; it also slices onions,
shaves cabbage, cuts croutons and does many things as no other
knife can, while smaller ones of different sizes all have their uses.</p>

<p>For stirring dry flour and meal into hot liquid, for gravies,
and for beating all batters, nothing can take the place of a
strong wire batter whip.</p>

<p>The “Surprise” beater with fine cross wires makes the whites
of eggs for meringues and cakes lighter than any other. The
smaller the wire around the edge, the lighter the eggs will be.
These very delicate ones are for sale in some of the five and ten
cent stores at 3 for 5c. Next to the “Surprise” beater for beating
whites of eggs comes the silver fork.</p>

<p>The “Dover” revolving beater gives a fine close grain when that
is desired, as in egg creams, the “Holt” coming next and being
more rapid in its work, while the “Lyon” gives a fine, fluffy result.
A large sized beater is more useful.</p>

<p>Eggs can be beaten in a deep bowl, narrow at the bottom (the
regular cooking bowl shape) in half the time that it takes to beat
them in a broad bottomed bowl. The nearer the sides of the
bowl are to the beater, the quicker the work will be done.
The same is true of whipping cream, and as cream spatters at
first, a pitcher or a tin can, not so deep but the handle of the
beater can be operated, is best for the purpose. It is better to
set the dish in the sink while whipping cream.</p>

<p>If possible have a good scale, as much more accurate results
are obtained in cooking by weight than by measure. It will be
useful in weighing articles from the grocery and market, for
weighing letters and papers for mailing and many other things.</p>

<p>When you have used a good bread mixer for a time, you would
not go back to the old, laborious way of kneading bread for double
its cost. The mixer also makes better bread than can be made
by hand.</p>

One of the greatest labor savers is a food cutter. A large sized
one, even for a small family, is most satisfactory. Many now
have a nut butter attachment which is desirable, though a regular
nut butter mill is preferable for nut preparations.</p>

<p>Try to have something for a quick fire. If you are out of the
reach of gas, a well-cared-for two burner oil stove will do good
service.</p>

<p>Eternal vigilance is the price of preventing double boilers from
going dry. Add more water before there is the least danger.</p>

<p>Rinse off the egg beater or batter whip and hang it in its place
as soon as you finish using it, before going on with what you are
doing, unless, as in some cakes, it needs to drain, then have
ready a pitcher, tin can or quart measure containing cold water
to drop it into after draining.</p>

<p>The cogs of an egg beater should never be wet; when they are
wet once, its usefulness is impaired.</p>

<p>The “Surprise” beater should never be touched with a cloth.</p>

<p>Always wipe a can opener after using, and hang it in its place.</p>

<p>Wire strainers should always be rinsed as soon as used; colanders
also, unless they require soaking, in which case put them
immediately into water.</p>

<p>Put sticky utensils to soaking as soon as emptied.</p>

<p>Rinse and put to draining everything that can be rinsed; then
it will be ready for use instead of rusting in the sink.</p>

<p>Never put knives, spatulas, egg beaters or whips in the sink;
always rinse them off at once.</p>

<p>Professional cooks never lay a knife down without wiping it
off. Clean, dry cloths or towels should be at hand for such purposes.</p>

<p>A side towel fastened to the waist is almost a necessity.</p>

<p>Never scrape a knife or spoon on the edge of a dish.</p>

<p>It is just as necessary and as satisfactory to keep the inside of
<a id="Page_14" class="pagenum" title="14"> </a>
the oven blackened as the top of the stove, and it is very little
more work.</p>

<p>Boil strong lye water in a scorched vessel (except aluminum),
before trying to clean it.</p>

<p>I have noticed that if a little water is boiled for a few minutes
in a close covered vessel in which some pasty food has been
cooked, the particles are so loosened by the steam that the vessel
washes easily.</p>

<p>I would suggest that instead of hanging the dish cloth on the
inside of the sink door, you put it on a line near the stove or
out of doors, where it will dry quickly.</p>

<p>Wet wooden spoons, chopping bowls and all wooden utensils
in cold water before using, to prevent their absorbing the flavors
and juices of foods.</p>

<p>Put new bread and cake tins into a hot oven and bake them
until they look like old ones, if you wish your bread and cake to
be well done on the bottom and sides.</p>

<p>Do not work in a “mess,” keep your tables wiped up as you go.</p>

<p>Above all, <em>pick up after yourself</em>. It is often more work to
pick up after people than to do the work.</p>

ECONOMY</h3>

<p>“Gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost.”
John 6:13.</p>

<p><i>True economy consists in using all of a good material, rather
than in buying an inferior quality.</i></p>

<p>It is poor economy from a financial standpoint (saying nothing
of health) to buy small or specked fruits or vegetables.</p>

<p>It takes longer to pare, quarter and core a specked apple than
a sound one, because the decayed part has first to be cut out
and one may have to cut again and again before it is all removed
and when it is finished there may not remain a quarter of an apple.</p>

<p>I once saw two barrels of apples bought at a great “bargain.”
Four or five people whose time was valuable spent an afternoon
in preparing those apples to stew; when they had finished, there
was just a bushel left and they were so flavorless that it was
necessary to add lemon juice and a good deal of sugar to make
them at all palatable.</p>

<p>C.&nbsp;F. Langworthy, Ph.&nbsp;D. in speaking of overripe and partially
decayed fruit says: “In addition to a deterioration in flavor,
there is always the possibility of digestive disturbance if such
fruit is eaten raw.”&mdash;<cite>Farmers’ Bulletin 293. U.&nbsp;S. Department
of Agriculture.</cite></p>

<p>Inferior, immature fruit, dried, requires a larger proportion of
sugar than well ripened fruit, and then it is neither palatable
nor wholesome.</p>

<p>Small prunes with their large proportion of stone and skin are
expensive besides being inferior in flavor.</p>

<p>It takes as long to pare, quarter and core a small apple as a
large one, and a bushel of large apples will yield more pulp than a
bushel of small ones, notwithstanding the spaces, there being a so
much larger proportion of skins and cores in the small ones.</p>

<p>Small pineapples are especially expensive.</p>

<p><a id="Page_16" class="pagenum" title="16"> </a>
“Cheap” flour costs more than the best because it takes a
larger quantity to make the same amount of bread.</p>

<p>Corn starch that costs two or three cents less per package than
the best will sometimes require double the quantity for thickening,
besides imparting a strong, disagreeable flavor.</p>

<p>Cotton seed oil that is not well refined, so that it is clear and
nearly white is not fit for food, and requires more for shortening.</p>

<p>Economy in all things, food, clothing, houses, climate is that
which keeps us in the best condition physically and spiritually.</p>


<h3 id="MISCELLANEOUS">MISCELLANEOUS</h3>

<p>All foods that are suitable should be used uncooked. They
are more nourishing and consequently more satisfying.</p>

<p>Foods containing starch should not be eaten raw.</p>

<p>Next to wholesomeness, make taste and palatability first.
There is nothing more disappointing than to taste of a daintily
arranged and decorated dish and find it flat and insipid.</p>

<p>Seek to develop the natural flavors of foods, of which there
are thousands, rather than to add foreign flavorings.</p>

<p>To stir fruits, legumes and many foods while cooking is just
the way to make them stick and scorch. Shake the vessels instead
of stirring.</p>

<p>To brush kettles and saucepans on the inside with oil, helps
to keep milk and other foods from sticking.</p>

<p>Use double boilers as far as possible for reheating gravies, cereals
and legumes, and for heating milk.</p>

<p>When, in spite of all precautions, something burns on, plunge
the vessel without ceremony into a pail or pan of cold water for
a moment, empty the contents immediately into another kettle,
add boiling water and return to the fire to finish cooking. Badly
scorched foods often lose all the scorched flavor by this treatment.</p>

<p><a id="Page_17" class="pagenum" title="17"> </a>
Remove the burnt portion from bread or cake with a grater,
when first taken from the oven.</p>

<p>Dip the knife into hot water to cut butter, warm bread or cake.</p>

<p>Two forks are better than a knife for separating steamed puddings,
fresh cake and many things.</p>

<p>Use pastry flour for gravies, sauces and all thickenings.</p>

<p>To blend flour and liquid for thickening, add only a little liquid
at a time, stirring with a fork or batter whip until a perfectly
smooth paste is formed, then add liquid to make of the consistency
of rather thin cream.</p>

<p>Flour, for thickening, gives a more creamy consistency than
corn starch. Use corn starch for fruit juices, as it leaves them
clearer.</p>

<p>Never mix flour or corn starch with eggs to stir into boiling
liquid, as they both require longer cooking than eggs will bear
without separating. Stir the blended flour or corn starch into
the liquid first, let it boil well, then pour the hot mixture gradually,
stirring, into the beaten eggs, return to the fire and cook
a moment if necessary, but do not boil.</p>

<p>In adding yolks of eggs to hot mixtures, put two or three
spoonfuls of the mixture on to the yolks, stirring, then add them,
all at once, to the whole.</p>

<p>Eggs must be added all at once to hot liquids so they will all
be cooked alike and a part will not curdle before the rest is done.</p>

<p>To prevent a raw taste, blended flour should be added to boiling
liquid so slowly as not to stop its boiling.</p>

<p>“Rich milk” means one-fourth to one-third cream.</p>

<p>Cream judiciously used is no more expensive from a financial
stand point than butter, and from a health standpoint it is cheaper.</p>

<p>Being in the form of an emulsion, cream does not hinder digestion
as does the free fat of butter. It should be sterilized before
using in uncooked dishes.</p>

<p><a id="Page_18" class="pagenum" title="18"> </a>
In the recipes in this book, heavy cream is meant unless thin
is specified.</p>

<p>It is cheaper to buy heavy cream than light, when there are
two qualities, and you can make it as thin as you wish.</p>

<p>When cream is scarce do not use it where oil and skimmed
milk will do just as well, but save it for uses where nothing else
will take its place.</p>

<p>Cream with water often gives a better flavor to foods than
milk, and is just as cheap.</p>

<p>For farmers, the use of cream saves the labor of making butter.</p>

<p>When taking cream, use fewer nuts and less butter and other
oils.</p>

<p>Nut creams and butters may always be substituted for dairy
cream and butter, with judgment as to flavors.</p>

<p>Peanut butter should be used sparingly and judiciously. No
one enjoys, as one man expressed it, “that everlasting peanut
flavor in everything.”</p>

<p>Oil and melted butter may be combined in equal quantities
when the butter flavor is desirable, as in pilau and drawn butter.</p>

<p>Oil makes more tender pastry, raised cakes and universal crust.</p>

<p>“Stale” bread crumbs are those of a two or three days old loaf.</p>

<p>Stale bread is understood for crumbs when no specification is
given.</p>

<p>A quick and easy way to prepare stale bread crumbs is to cut
very thin slices from the loaf, lay them together and cut as thin
as possible across one way and then the other with a large sharp
knife into tiny dice.</p>

<p>“Dry” crumbs are those from a loaf dry enough to grate or grind.</p>

<p>Save all pieces of bread not usable for croutons or other things,
dry without browning, and roll or grind, for dry crumbs; sift,
leaving two sizes of crumbs.</p>

<p><a id="Page_19" class="pagenum" title="19"> </a>
When bread crumbs are used for puddings or molds the quantity
will vary with the kind of bread. Fewer will be required
with home-made bread than with baker’s bread.</p>

<p>Bread, cracker or zwieback crumbs, corn meal, flour or browned
flour No.&nbsp;1, or a mixture of crumbs and brown or white flour
may be used for rolling croquettes or cutlets, or for sprinkling
the top of scallops or gratins.</p>

<p>Nut meal is suitable for the outside of rice croquettes and the
top of many dishes.</p>

<p>Grated or chopped onion is apt to become bitter if prepared
long before using.</p>

<p>To extract the juice from lemons without a drill, cut them in
halves without rolling, the same as for a drill, then holding each
half over a strainer in a bowl, work the point of a spoon from
the cut surface in and around gradually to the rind. This method
removes the juice cleaner than does the drill.</p>

<p>Another way is to roll the lemon and puncture it at one end
with a silver fork, then squeeze the juice out. This leaves the
seeds inside.</p>

<p>Dry lemons yield more juice than fresh ones.</p>

<p>Remove the pulp from lemons for pies and other uses by cutting
them lengthwise in the middle of the sections and scraping
each side of the membrane, or by cutting the lemon in halves
crosswise and taking the pulp out with a spoon.</p>

<p>To keep lemons and oranges from molding, spread them on a
shelf in a dry place so that they will not touch each other. They
may be covered with glass tumblers if in a cool as well as dry
place.</p>

<p>To core apples, insert a steel fork at the blossom end and turn
it round and round, then repeat from the stem end.</p>

<p>The half shell of an egg will remove bits of shell from broken
eggs much better than a spoon.</p>

<p><a id="Page_20" class="pagenum" title="20"> </a>
My mother taught me to use too little rather than too much
salt in foods, saying it was easier to add it than to take it out.</p>

<p>Salt varies so much in saltness that it is impossible to give
definite rules for its use.</p>

<p>Have a shelf over the stove for zwieback, crackers and toasted
cereals to keep them crisp.</p>

<p>Keep a dish of oil on or near your work table.</p>

<p>Have a small tin of pastry flour on the table to use for thickening
sauces; also a small bowl or tin of sugar, and one of corn
starch if using it frequently, and a box of salt, of course.</p>

<p>If a thickened mixture is allowed to any more than boil up
well, after lemon juice is added, it will become thin.</p>

<p>Finely-sliced, tender, raw celery is much to be preferred to
cooked, in timbales, croquettes, batters and sauces.</p>

<p>Never chop celery; slice it fine instead.</p>

<p>The word “meat” as used in this book refers to true meats,
not flesh meats, but is confined to such foods as are rich in proteids,
not being taken in its broadest sense.</p>

<p>Use soft butter for oiling molds to be decorated, as that holds
the decorations better than oil.</p>

<p>To unmold, dip the mold in hot water a moment.</p>

<p>Both oil and crumb molds for delicate fillings.</p>

<p>Dip molds in cold water, invert and turn quickly right side up
without draining, for gelatine and other fillings to be served cold.</p>

<p>Many foods gain in richness of flavor by being reheated; and
for that reason, left overs often make more appetizing dishes
than fresh cooked foods.</p>

<p>Reheat foods, legumes, vegetables, cereals, or fruits, to preserve
them, before they begin to show signs of spoiling.</p>

<p>Only a small quantity of sugar, proportionately, should be added
to yolks of eggs, or they will gather in small, hard particles
and become useless.</p>

<p><a id="Page_21" class="pagenum" title="21"> </a>
Ice water crisps and freshens such vegetables as lettuce, parsley,
cabbage and cucumbers as that just a little warmer will not.</p>

<p>In multiplying a recipe to make a larger quantity of soup or
other liquid food, use a smaller proportion of liquid; or in dishes
containing thickening take a larger proportion of flour, as the
evaporation is not so great in proportion to the quantity.</p>

<p>The alcohol of yeast or of flavoring extracts goes off in the
steam in cooking.</p>

<p>When eggs are used in cakes, breads, puddings or other dishes,
fewer nuts, nut foods, legumes or other proteid foods will be required.</p>

<p>Bake soufflés and dishes made light with eggs, slowly, as when
baked rapidly they puff up quickly and fall just as quickly; while
if baked slowly, they retain their lightness.</p>

<p>Timbales, puddings and all molds to be served hot should stand
5 or 10 m. in a warm place after removing from the fire, before
unmolding.</p>

<p>Place a cold wet towel over pudding molds to loosen, if inclined
to stick.</p>

<p>Do not chop nut meats fine for roasts, cakes or puddings.
Sometimes leave<!--TN: was 'leaves'--> them whole, or just break them a little.</p>

<p>To try vegetables for tenderness, use a sharp pointed knife
rather than a fork.</p>

<p>Batter and plum puddings and brown bread may be steamed in
the oven by setting the mold containing them into a vessel of
water with a tight fitting cover.</p>

<p>To steam in glass, set dishes or jars first into cold water and
bring to boiling, then set into steamer.</p>

<p>Honey attracts moisture, consequently it should be kept in a
warm dry place.</p>

<p>In discarding unwholesome foods be sure to put something
wholesome in their place; in other words, employ a system of
substitution rather than one of subtraction.</p>

<p><a id="Page_22" class="pagenum" title="22"> </a>
For instance, for this book we have taken pains to search out
a variety of harmless flavorings to be used in place of the irritating
condiments, such as mustard, pepper, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg
and cloves; and instead of the acetic acid of vinegar, we use
lemon juice&mdash;citric acid.</p>

<p>“Vinegar&mdash;acetic acid, is about ten times as strong as alcohol
and makes more trouble in the stomach than any of the other
acids except oxalic.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">Dr. Rand.</i></p>

<p>“Do not eat largely of salt.”</p>

<p>“Very hot food ought not to be taken into the stomach. Soups,
puddings and other articles of the kind are often eaten too hot,
and as a consequence the stomach is debilitated.”</p>

<p>Many people can digest cream better when accompanied by an
acid fruit.</p>

<p>While using oil enough to keep the machinery of the body
lubricated, take care not to use too much. People with dilated
stomachs can take very little, and that little best in salad dressings
or as shortening with flour.</p>

<p>Malt gives flesh but not strength; too much is harmful.</p>

<p>Flesh is more often a sign of disease than of health. Good
solid firm muscle is to be cultivated.</p>

<p>Taste is a matter of education. Let us educate ourselves to
like the things that are good for us.</p>

<p>“Perseverance in a self-denying course of eating and drinking
will soon make plain, wholesome food palatable, and it will be
eaten with greater satisfaction than the epicure enjoys over his
rich dainties.”</p>


<h3 id="MEASUREMENTS"><a id="Page_23" class="pagenum" title="23"> </a>
MEASUREMENTS</h3>

<p>Flour is always sifted once before measuring and is laid into
the measure lightly with a spoon to just level, without being
shaken down; when measured otherwise, results will not be correct.</p>

<p>The measurements of tablespoons and teaspoons in this book
are for slightly rounded spoons, as granulated sugar would be
when the spoon is shaken sidewise. This seems the natural way
of measuring. When level spoons are specified, the spoon is
leveled off with a spatula or the straight edge of a knife.</p>

<p>The half-pint cup is the standard measuring cup.</p>

<p>A cupful is all the cup will hold without running over.</p>

<h3 id="FLAVORINGS">FLAVORINGS</h3>

<p>If we heed the injunction of the wise man to eat for strength
and not for drunkenness, we will exclude the burning, irritating
condiments from our dietary, since they by causing a feverish
state of the system and creating “a thirst which water cannot
quench,” are among the greatest causes of inebriety.</p>

<p>When our sense of taste is not benumbed or destroyed by
harmful accompaniments we are in a condition to keenly enjoy
the thousands of fine, delicate flavors that our loving Father has
placed in wholesome foods.</p>

<p><a id="Page_25" class="pagenum" title="25"> </a>
Among the stronger flavors for those who do not at once enjoy
the delicate ones, we have sage, savory, thyme, marjoram,
rosemary, bay leaf, garlic, onion, chives and leeks.</p>

<p>Then come celery salt and seed, leaves and stalks; lemon
thyme, shallots, spearmint, parsley, basil and tarragon.</p>

<p>The flavors of carrots, turnips, cabbage and spinach have
their place.</p>

<p>The small leaf buds of sassafras may be dried and ground for
soups and stews.</p>

<p>Celery leaves dried with gentle heat make excellent flavorings.
They may be powdered by rubbing through a wire strainer the
same as leaf sage.</p>

<p>Crush stalks of celery and let them stand in the soup or
sauce to be flavored for 15 m., then remove them.</p>

<p>For a fresh positive onion flavor, let slices of onion stand in
the food for 5 or 10 m.</p>

<p>The flavor of garlic is usually obtained by rubbing the dish in
which the food is to be served or the spoon with which it is stirred
with the cut surface of one of the cloves or sections. Slice
it and crush it with salt when using it in cooked foods. One
clove will flavor a large quantity.</p>

<p>Use bay leaf in the proportion of one large leaf to a quart of
liquid.</p>

<p>As far as possible raise your own herbs. If in no other way,
plant them in pots and boxes in the house. Somewhere I have
seen the suggestion of planting parsley in holes in the sides of a
barrel which has been sawed in two, and such plants as sage,
thyme, mint, basil and tarragon in the top.</p>

<p>Gather herbs before flowering, dry in the shade, tie in paper
sacks and hang in a dry place. Powder only a small quantity at
a time and keep in close covered small jars. Fresh herbs, especially
mint and tarragon, when obtainable, are far superior to
dry ones.</p>

<p><a id="Page_26" class="pagenum" title="26"> </a>
The fact that raising any oil to a temperature high enough to
brown it, decomposes it and produces a poisonous acid&mdash;a powerful
irritant&mdash;is one of the best known to science.</p>

<p>Flour is rendered more digestible by browning and when combined
with cream, oil or butter, gives the browned oil flavor
without the poison.</p>

<p>To prepare browned flour, sift <em>bread</em> flour into a broad flat
pan, let it stand in a warm oven, stirring occasionally, until thoroughly
dry, then gradually increase the heat of the oven, stirring
often, until the desired degree of brownness is reached.</p>

<p>A delicate cream color, so light that you would hardly know
there was any color except by comparing it with flour that had
not been in the oven, gives a delightfully meaty flavor to some
gravies and sauces. A light or medium brown is convenient to
have at times, but the one most useful is the dark chestnut
brown. The darker it is the longer it will last, as less of it will
be required for flavoring.</p>

<p>To obtain this color a very high degree of heat will be required
at the last, with almost constant stirring. As this dark flour
lasts so long (I seldom make it more than once in a year for a
large family), it pays to give it the necessary attention at every
stage. Do not try to hurry it. If you begin browning it before
it is thoroughly dry, it will burn. When done, sift and keep in
close covered can or jar.</p>

<p>The lightest shade (which for convenience we call No.&nbsp;1, and
the others No.&nbsp;2 and 3) should be prepared oftener as it becomes
stale by standing. No.&nbsp;3 will keep indefinitely. It is used for
flavoring only as it will not thicken. Where consistency is desired,
combine it with unbrowned flour. No.&nbsp;1 will thicken nearly
as much as though it had not been in the oven, and No.&nbsp;2 a little.</p>

<p>When no number is given in recipes calling for browned flour,
No.&nbsp;3 is understood.</p>

<p>Browned flour, onion and a small quantity of tomato (not
<a id="Page_27" class="pagenum" title="27"> </a>
enough to give a tomato taste) combined, form the basis of meaty
flavors in foods.</p>

<p>To these, add sometimes a bay leaf, a very little sage and a
trifle of thyme. Again, add bay leaf, grated or chopped carrot
and a very few celery tops, dried or fresh.</p>

<p>Garlic combines well with either of these combinations, and
powdered or soaked dried mushrooms are a delightful addition.</p>

<p>Butter (oil or part oil) and a little onion with parsley seem
something like chicken.</p>

<p>Juniper berries are thought to give the flavor of game. Not
more than a teaspoonful of crushed berries should be used to the
quart of stew.</p>

<p>Combine flavors so that no one is prominent but the whole
combination pleasing.</p>

<p>Use herbs and all strong flavorings sparingly. One colored
cook of experience expressed it when she said, “I put in just a
trifle of sage, not enough to make it vulgar.”</p>

<p>Withal, have a variety; do not use the same flavors day after
day.</p>


<h4>Brown Onion Flavor</h4>

<div class="subtitle">
For sauces, soups and croquettes.
</div>

<p>Cook together sliced onions, browned flour and oil with salt
and water until onions are tender; strain, keep in cool place.</p>


<h4>FOR SWEETS</h4>

<p>Steep peach leaves in water for almond flavor.</p>

<p>Finely-ground coriander seed is a delightful and not unwholesome
flavoring. It is cheaper to buy the seed by the pound. A
half pound will go a long way. Do not grind too much at a time.</p>

<p>Ground anise seed in minute quantities is unequaled for some
things, but is disagreeable when used too liberally.</p>

<p>For sweet dishes to be flavored with lemon or orange, score
the rind of the fruit lightly with a sharp-tined fork. Drop the
<a id="Page_28" class="pagenum" title="28"> </a>
scored fruit into the measured sugar and rub it well with the sugar.</p>

<p>Another way of obtaining the flavor, also of grape fruit, is to
pour boiling water over the thinly-pared yellow rind and when
cold, strain. For salads, let that thin rind stand in the lemon
or other fruit juices for a time and then remove.</p>

<p>When obliged to use lemon or orange extracts, use only a few
drops instead of the teaspoonful of the average recipe.</p>

<p>Rose is another of the delightful flavors to be used sparingly.</p>

<p>To flavor with cocoanut, when the fibre is not desired, steep
(do not boil) the cocoanut in milk for 15&ndash;20 m., then strain it out.</p>


<h4>SALAD FLAVORINGS</h4>

<p>To flavor lemon juice for cooked or uncooked dressings, take
to each three tablespns. of lemon juice and one of water, a slice
of onion, a bay leaf, and ¼ teaspn. of celery seed or 1 tablespn.
of chopped celery leaves. Boil a moment, then cool and strain.
Tarragon and chives may be used for the flavorings. Onion,
bay leaf, thyme, a trifle of garlic if liked, and a few thin yellow-slices
of orange peel make another combination.</p>

<p>The salad dish is sometimes rubbed with the cut surface of a
clove of garlic or a slice of onion, or onion may be chopped or
grated. Crushed celery seed is liked by some in salad dressings.
Spearmint is very refreshing. Delicate tender sassafras leaves
may be used in fruit and nut meat salads.</p>

<p>Shredded fresh mint combines well with orange or grape fruit
or with currant juice; tarragon with red raspberries and currants,
and basil with peaches.</p>

<p>In closing the subject of flavorings, I quote the words of a
lady visitor after sampling some of the dishes prepared by a class
in cookery:</p>

<p>“Any one can give a taste to foods by adding condiments and
flavorings, but to develop the flavors of the foods themselves is
an art.”</p>


<h3 id="GARNISHING"><a id="Page_29" class="pagenum" title="29"> </a>
GARNISHING</h3>

<p>The saying that “some people eat with their eyes” is true to a
great extent of all of us. I believe that the veriest savage
would better enjoy his dinner, however rude, if somewhere there
were tucked into it a bit of green. The busy farmer’s wife as
she goes to the wood pile for an armful of wood can quickly pick
off a spray of May weed, dropping it into a tin of cold water as
she passes the water pail, and her platter of beans for dinner is
transformed, in the eyes of those children, into a thing of beauty,
and what effect may it not have in the formation of their characters?</p>

<p>Of variety in garnishing there need be no lack with the garden,
wayside and woods abounding in beautiful leaves, vines and
flowers.</p>

<p>There are foliage plant, geranium, and autumn leaves, ferns
in variety, with lettuce, endive, spinach, parsley, chervil and
carrot tops. The variegated variety of beet leaves, as also the
bright blossoms of nasturtiums make a brilliant garnish.</p>

<p>Put parsley, ferns, and all of the green leaves and vines into
very cold water as soon as gathered and leave for some time,
then keep in paper sacks in a cold place away from the wind.
Repeat the cold water bath at intervals.</p>

<p>Barberries canned, or preserved in brine, candied cranberries
or cherries, green grapes in brine, designs cut from orange, lemon
grape fruit and tangerine rinds, tomatoes in slices or in lengthwise
pieces, and slices of lemon or orange with the skin on are
all suitable garnishes at times.</p>

<p>Lemon cups, having a slice cut off from the ends so that they
will stand, may be used for mayonnaise or small servings of salad.</p>

<p>Orange and grape fruit halves with tops notched or scalloped
or sometimes cut in deep points rolled down, and orange baskets
make a change of service. All of these fruit cups should be kept
<a id="Page_30" class="pagenum" title="30"> </a>
in ice water or chopped ice until serving time, then thoroughly
dried with a soft towel.</p>

<p>Blood oranges and gelatine oranges are novelties for garnishing.</p>

<p>Sprays of maidenhair fern are pretty under grape fruit and orange
cups.</p>

<p>All cups or glasses containing salads or creams should be
served on doilies on small plates.</p>

<p>To prepare fringed celery, cut the stalks into two- or three-in.
lengths, then slice very fine from each end to within ¾&ndash;1 in. of
the center and leave in ice water for a time. Do not lay in ice
water before preparing. The short tender stalks may have the
leaves left on and be shredded at the opposite end. Celery <em>leaves</em>
make a desirable garnish.</p>

<p>Cut carrots, beets and yellow turnips into slices or sticks, or
into round pieces with an open-top thimble or a round pastry
tube, and into fancy shapes with vegetable cutters, selecting cutters
which have not sharp points or slender stems.</p>


<h4>Radish Lilies</h4>

<p>Get either the turnip or olive shaped radishes, wash them well,
trim off just the slender tips and all but one or two of the smallest
leaves. With a thin, sharp knife cut them into halves from
the tip end almost to the stem, and the same way into quarters
and eighths. Then carefully loosen the rind of each section as
far down as it is cut and throw the radishes into ice water, leaving
them there for several hours or overnight, when they will
have bloomed into beautiful lilies. Pure white or yellow lilies
may be made from yellow or white radishes. Serve directly
from the ice water, and the radishes will be crisp and sweet and
easily digested.</p>

<p>Just one radish sometimes, in a spray or two of parsley or
chervil is better than a more elaborate garnish; a red radish sliced
or cut into quarters or sixths is pretty in a little green.</p>

<p><a id="Page_31" class="pagenum" title="31"> </a>
Roll up imperfect leaves of lettuce and slice in thin slices,
then pick up lightly and use for borders or nests or beds.</p>

<p>Dry parsley thoroughly in a towel before chopping. For rolling,
spread the particles out, a little distance apart, so as to just
fleck whatever is rolled in it.</p>

<p>Use nuts chopped or in halves or broken pieces for borders or
nests of fruit or vegetable salads; never put them into the dressing.</p>


<h4>Potato Balls</h4>

<p>Potatoes may be cut into balls with a vegetable scoop, boiled
until just tender, not broken, drained, sprinkled with chopped
parsley and used for garnishing a true meat dish.</p>


<h4>Egg Daisies</h4>

<p>Cut the hard boiled yolks of eggs into round pieces and the
whites into petal shapes for daisies for decorating the tops of
small spinach or other timbales or molds.</p>

<p>The whites and yolks are better poached separately for garnishing.
Cut whites with vegetable cutters sometimes.</p>


<h4>Oxeye Daisies</h4>

<p>Use the end of a small black olive for the center of daisies, and
carrots for the leaves.</p>

<p>Toast points or croutons of different shapes are suitable garnishes
for timbales, eggs, broiled mushrooms and true meat or
vegetable stews, or we may use pieces of bread of different shapes
that have been dipped in egg yolks and milk and baked. Breaded
triangles, squares or circles, of corn meal porridge may be used
to garnish the edge of a platter for a stew.</p>

<p>Serve some creamed dishes or stews in shells of pastry.</p>

<p>Turk’s head and border molds may be decorated with truffles
or other decorations, and used for meat dishes for variety.</p>

<p>Button mushrooms may be used for garnishing individual timbales.</p>

<p>Cut left overs of pie crust or cracker dough into fancy shapes,
<a id="Page_32" class="pagenum" title="32"> </a>
for scalloped dishes, salads and some desserts, and into squares,
diamonds or strips for peas and other vegetables.</p>

<p>For legumes or other meat dishes, sometimes use carrots in
dice or slices, sprinkled with chopped parsley or interspersed
with sprigs of parsley.</p>

<p>Lemon Points.&mdash;Cut slices of lemon into four or six parts.</p>


<h4>Pastry Bag</h4>

<p>The pastry bag gives variety in garnishing and decorating. The
bag itself may be of rubber, paper or cloth. Cloth for all purposes
is the most practical. To make, take “Indian Head” or
other heavy cloth, cut it into any sized square desired; fold and
sew together in cornucopia shape (the seam is better felled), trim
the top evenly and hem; then cut off a very little from the point
and hem that, leaving the opening just large enough to insert
the tubes one-third to one-half their length.</p>

<p>Paper bags may be used in an emergency, and rubber for some
purposes, but not for anything containing oil.</p>

<p>Mashed peas and potatoes should not be too dry for decorating.</p>

<p>Mayonnaise dressing and whipped cream should be stiff, as
also meringues.</p>


<h3>COLORINGS</h3>

<h4>Pokeberry&mdash;Carmine</h4>

<p>Cover berries with water, boil till the skins break, strain, add
1 cup of sugar to each pint of juice; boil, bottle, seal.</p>

<p><i>For Red</i>, cook strained tomato to a thick pulp; or slice a bright
red raw beet into cold water and let it stand on the stove where
it will heat slowly to a little below the boiling point and strain.</p>

<p><i>For Green</i>, bruise parsley, spinach, chervil, onion tops, chives,
tarragon or lettuce, with or without lemon, and press out the
juice for coloring.</p>

<p><i>For Yellow</i>, steep saffron in boiling water for ½&ndash;1 hour and
strain when cold.</p>

<p><a id="Page_33" class="pagenum" title="33"> </a>
When these colorings are not suitable, the so-called “fruit
colors” for sale at the groceries may be used. Use only enough
for delicate shades.</p>


<h3>ARRANGEMENT AND GARNISHING OF SALADS</h3>

<p>The arrangement and garnishing of salads depends largely
upon individual taste and skill in the use of things at hand, and
is a matter of importance.</p>

<p>The garnish should be a suitable one and should harmonize
with the ingredients of the salad. For example, a dainty flower
or vine with a delicate fruit salad, and slices or fancy shapes of
vegetables with true meat salads.</p>

<p>Red apple, or tomato cups may be used for light colored salads,
and yellow tomato, or green and white apple cups for bright ones.</p>

<p>Juicy fruit salads should be served in dainty glasses or cups;
and a correspondingly dainty doily on the plate underneath the
glass with a delicate flower or leaf by its side, leaves nothing to
be desired.</p>

<h2 id="FRUITS"><a id="Page_34" class="pagenum" title="34"> </a>
FRUITS</h2>


<h3 id="FRESH">FRUITS&mdash;FRESH</h3>

<p>“Man has always thrived as he has eaten freely of fruits.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">H.
Irving Hancock.</i></p>

<p>“The best food on this planet is ripe fruit. The healthiest
people on the globe are the fruit eaters of tropical countries.
The great muscular Maoris of New Zealand are a frugiverous race.
I have seen a boat crew of these great chocolate colored giants
that would outrow the ‘crack’ university crews were they properly
trained. The bread fruit of the Samoan Islands has made a
race of giants. I have examined these men and women on their
native soil and finer human specimens never lived.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">Dr. Paul
Edwards.</i></p>

<p>“The more we depend upon the fresh fruit just as it is plucked
from the tree, the greater will be the blessing.”</p>

<p>“It would be well for us to do less cooking and to eat more
fruit in its natural state. Eat freely of fresh grapes, apples,
peaches, pears, berries and all other kinds of fruit that can be
obtained.”</p>

<p>Fruits supply sugar, acids, mineral matter and bulk. The
mineral elements of fruits are more readily assimilated than those
of flesh meat and vegetables. Acid fruits aid in the digestion of
nuts and other nitrogenous foods. Acid, juicy fruits keep the
system clean and free from germs. They render lime and soda
salts soluble, enabling the system to throw them off. They <em>allay</em>
instead of <em>creating</em> thirst. Alcohol and tobacco cannot stay
long with the individual who uses no flesh foods and partakes
freely of ripe juicy fruits. Use more fruit and fewer vegetables
if you would not experience thirst.</p>

<p>Cane sugar is not digested in the stomach but causes fermentation
<a id="Page_35" class="pagenum" title="35"> </a>
by hindering the digestion of other foods. The sugar of
fruits (grape and fruit sugar, so-called), and that of honey are all
ready for assimilation, so require less labor on the part of the
body and may be used more rapidly for the repair of muscular
fatigue.</p>

<p>The laxative effect of fruit is very important. Very ripe bananas
taken when the stomach is empty often produce immediate
effect. Pineapples after nitrogenous foods, ripe olives, peaches,
pears and nearly all fruits are helpful.</p>

<p>It is better to use the juice and pulp only, of seedy fruits like
blackberries and black raspberries. With many people the seeds
produce hives.</p>

<p>The matter of bulk in the diet is an important one. The whole
digestive tract suffers if there is not a fairly good bulk of food to
be handled by it, yet serious results follow when a large quantity
of concentrated food is consumed; consequently, fruits and green
vegetables being composed largely of water supply just what is
needed.</p>

<p>Fruit must be thoroughly ripened, sound and well matured.
Many unripe fruits contain raw starch which causes trouble when
they are eaten.</p>

<p>The largest fruit of its kind is usually the cheapest. It is poor
economy to spend money and (if the fruit requires paring) time,
for seeds, skins, and cores. Besides, as a rule the larger fruit is
more perfectly matured, so more wholesome as well as of a finer
flavor.</p>

<p>Do not use the skins of fruits much. They are composed
largely of woody fibre and are intended only for a covering to the
fruit. In the days of stomach washes, the skins of fruits were
noticeably abundant in the “unswallowed” food.</p>

<p>For the best effect, fruits should be used without sugar. When
one has accustomed himself to the use of grape fruit and oranges
without sugar, the addition of it will make them positively disagreeable
<a id="Page_36" class="pagenum" title="36"> </a>
to his taste, besides causing rebellion in the stomach.</p>

<p>Since acids hinder the digestion of starch, it is better to take
acid fruits at the close of a meal including starchy foods, and we
should especially avoid taking starches and acids into the mouth
at the same time, before the starch has been acted upon by the
saliva.</p>

<p>There is great opportunity for the display of artistic skill in
serving fresh fruits, and nothing so well repays a little effort as
the combination of leaves, ferns and vines with fruits. One
beautiful dish that I remember was of plums, grapes and peaches
with autumn leaves; another, with rich branches of foliage plants
and a variety of fruits. Grape leaves combine beautifully with
fruits.</p>

<p>One person with whom I am acquainted can use no starchy
foods. The many attempts which she has made to use them invariably
result in her becoming extremely weak, and helpless
with rheumatism; but she thrives on a diet composed almost exclusively
of acid fruits and nuts. She writes&mdash;“On my fruit and
nut diet I seldom feel thirst, but after eating even starchless
vegetables I suffer exceedingly from it. I find also that I do not
require so much sleep as when living on another diet.” Her
chief fruits are sour apples, grape fruit, oranges and mealy-ripe
bananas with a few raisins, dates and figs occasionally for dessert.
She is at her best when currants are ripe; and takes them every
day as long as they can be obtained.</p>

<h4>APPLES</h4>

<p>The apple, of which there are said to be over 2000 varieties,
has no equal as an “all-round” fruit; but it is at its best just
pared and eaten raw. It requires thorough mastication both
for digestion and enjoyment.</p>

<p>When you are not feeling quite at par, cut an apple in two
from stem to blossom end and with a round pointed knife scrape
it into a fine pulp from either side. It is most refreshing and
<a id="Page_37" class="pagenum" title="37"> </a>
easily digested so. Children and people whose teeth are defective
can take it best that way.</p>

<p>The apple is the choicest salad fruit.</p>

<h4>BANANAS</h4>

<p>The fact that the banana is a serious cause of indigestion when
just turned yellow is quite generally understood, and fruit eaters
now buy them and keep them until they become not just soft,
but <em>mellow ripe</em>, which will be after the skins are dark or covered
with dark spots. As long as they have a “pasty” feeling in the
mouth they are unfit for food because the starch is not yet
changed to sugar.</p>

<p>Do not try to hurry the ripening process as bananas are better
when ripened slowly. Keep them in the dark, in a not too
cold place and give them plenty of time. Large, plump bananas
are far superior to small slender ones in wholesomeness and flavor,
besides being cheaper.</p>

<p>There is no other way of using bananas to compare with
eating them “out of hand” with the skin and fibres removed;
but they may be served with sugar and lemon juice for luncheon
or with whipped cream for dessert.</p>

<p>Almond cream is very harmonious with bananas. Peeled bananas
with a little almond butter accompanying each mouthful
make a complete and delightful luncheon. Brazil nut butter
and cream are also excellent with bananas.</p>


<h4>BLACKBERRIES</h4>

<p>Wild blackberries are sweeter and finer flavored than cultivated
ones and eaten in small quantities from the bush are very
enjoyable, but they should not be taken in large quantities with
their seeds. They may be served with nut, or whipped dairy
cream. With a thin syrup of sugar and water they are delicious.</p>


<h4>CANTALOUPE</h4>

<p>Wash, drain, chill, cut in halves and remove the seeds with a
<a id="Page_38" class="pagenum" title="38"> </a>
round-pointed spoon (not a sharp pointed knife) or with the fingers.
Do not put ice inside as it destroys the flavor. Serve on
mat of grape leaves.</p>


<h4>CURRANTS</h4>

<p>Wash, drain, serve on the stems plain or around a mold of
sugar (made by pressing not too dry powdered or granulated
sugar into a small glass, and unmolding in the center of the plate),
or a spoonful of sugar, on a dainty dish. Nice, very ripe currants
are especially refreshing and reviving.</p>


<h5>Frosted Currants</h5>

<p>Pick fine even bunches of currants and dip them, one at a<!--TN: deleted double 'a'-->
time, into a mixture of frothed white of egg and a very little
cold water. Drain them until nearly dry and roll in powdered
sugar. Repeat the dip in the sugar once or twice and lay them
on white paper to dry. Use as a garnish.</p>


<h4>DATES AND NUTS</h4>

<p>Serve dates piled on a dessert plate with halves of nuts around,
or on individual dishes with a spoonful of any desired nut butter
or meal in the center of the dish.</p>


<h4>DATES AND CREAM</h4>

<p>Slice dates and cover with nut or dairy cream. Dairy cream
may be whipped and piled in center of dish with fruit around.</p>


<h4>DATES OR FIGS AND MILK</h4>

<p>One writer on health subjects recommends dates and milk or
figs and milk as an improvement upon bread and milk. They
make an excellent combination and a satisfying meal.</p>

<p>Nut milk or nut cream are ideal for sweet fruits.</p>


<h4>FIGS</h4>

<p>Serve figs with nuts and with cream, the same as dates.
For Stuffed Dates and Figs, see <a href="#CONFECTIONS">Confections</a>.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_39" class="pagenum" title="39"> </a>
GOOSEBERRIES</h4>

<p>Nice large ripe gooseberries are most enjoyable right from the
bushes.</p>


<h4>GRAPES</h4>

<p>There is perhaps no fruit more highly recommended than the
grape. One says: “It is safe to say that the juice of no other
fruit or vegetable so strikingly resembles blood in its composition
as the unfermented juice of grapes.”</p>

<p>Another: “Grapes eaten exclusively for several days bring
about wonderful results in the system. From one to two pounds
should be consumed daily at first, gradually increasing to eight
or ten pounds.”</p>

<p>The “grape cures” in France and Germany are too well known
to require mention. There is said to be “a life giving principle
in grapes which builds tissue and stimulates the sympathetic
nervous system.”</p>

<p>These quotations apply particularly to fresh grapes. Cooked
grapes and juice do not agree with every one.<!--TN: changed comma to period--></p>


<h5>TO PACK GRAPES</h5>

<p>Take the late grapes, pick them carefully, spread them in a
cool place in layers on shelves, let them remain two weeks, then
pack in barrels with dry hard-wood sawdust. Bran will answer
very well. Packed in this manner the fruit will keep good
through the winter it is said. After packing, grapes should be
kept in a cool, dry place.</p>


<h4>GRAPE FRUIT</h4>

<p>Cut in halves crosswise, remove seeds with sharp pointed knife,
and separate the pulp from the bitter membrane between the
sections. Serve one half to each person in peel or small glass,
or serve halves after removing seeds without separating pulp.
The fruit should not be cut long before serving as the juice and
pulp absorb the bitter of the cut membrane. Taken at the close
of the meal, grape fruit is an aid to digestion. The effect will be
<a id="Page_40" class="pagenum" title="40"> </a>
better without sugar. As a dessert, it is sometimes served with a
tablespoonful of thick maple syrup in the center.</p>


<h5>GRAPE FRUIT WITH MALAGA GRAPES</h5>

<p>Prepare grape fruit as for salad, combine with halved, seeded
Malaga grapes and sugar; refill cups which have been wiped
dry after standing in ice water. Garnish with candied cherries
or blanched almonds.</p>


<h5>GRAPE FRUIT AMBROSIA</h5>

<p>Mix grape fruit pulp with orange pulp, grated cocoanut and
sugar. Serve, sprinkled with cocoanut, in its own cups or in
glasses.</p>


<h4>OLIVES</h4>

<p>“When properly prepared, olives like nuts supply the place of
butter and flesh meats. Oil as eaten in the olive is far preferable
to animal oil or fat. It serves as a laxative. Its use will
be found beneficial to consumptives and it is healing to an inflamed,
irritated stomach.”</p>

<p>The olive contains more protein than any of the other common
fruits, and with the exception of the alligator pear is the
only one containing any appreciable amount of oil. Until within
a few years we have been eating this valuable fruit in its unripe
state, but now we get it, both imported and home grown,
ripe. There is just as much difference between a ripe and green
olive as between a ripe and green apple.</p>

<p>The ripe olive is black or dark brown in color (according to
where it was grown) and has its full quota of oil. After one has
eaten ripe olives for a time, the green ones will have a harsh,
rank taste to him. It is also much easier to acquire a taste for
the ripe olive. The large, luscious ones with meat as thick as
that of a good sized plum are truly delightful.</p>

<p>Those hurried on to the eastern market from California before
the holidays are not thoroughly ripened, but there are some
<a id="Page_41" class="pagenum" title="41"> </a>
growers who hold them until properly matured before gathering.
Olives are better just soaked a little and eaten in that state than
to be used in cooked dishes; but when used in soups or sauces,
add without cooking just before serving.</p>

<p>Ripe olives are a valuable substitute for butter with bread,
giving an emulsified oil instead of a free fat, with no germs of
tuberculosis or other diseases.</p>

<p>The dried olives sold by Italian grocers require a long soaking
and several changes of water. They, too, become stronger
flavored by cooking. They are considerably cheaper than the
bottled ones but much less delicate in flavor.</p>


<h4>ORANGES</h4>

<p>“The one thing that quickest revives a human being is orange
juice.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">Dr. Paul Edwards.</i></p>

<p>“The orange is a fruit that is distinctly health-giving. Orange
juice aids greatly in reducing the amount of putrefaction in the
intestines of nearly all persons who are submitted to clinical
laboratory tests.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">H. Irving Hancock, in “Good Housekeeping.”</i></p>

<p>The white separating membrane of the orange is rather indigestible,
so in many cases it is better to use the juice or pulp only.</p>

<p>I am going to tell you how to “drink” oranges. First, cut
the orange in halves from end to end, then cut each half in three
or four pieces; place each one of these oblong cups to the lips
and extract the juice, rejecting the seeds and leaving all the
membrane. This method is most refreshing, if not elegant.
Eaten with a spoon from the halves cut across is, next to this,
most satisfying, but takes more time.</p>

<p>In Jamaica they peel off the outer yellow skin and cut the
orange across into two unequal portions. They extract the juice
and pulp from the larger stem section first, and reserve the
smaller, sweeter section for the last.</p>

<p>Again, they peel the yellow part of the rind off about one-fourth
<a id="Page_42" class="pagenum" title="42"> </a>
of the way down, run the knife into the peeled end and cut away
a conical portion of the pulp, thus opening all of the sections of
the orange. They then suck out the juice, without any burned
lips as the result.</p>

<p>One nice way to prepare the pulp is to peel the fruit as you
would an apple, cutting deep enough to remove all the white
portion of the covering; then to cut all around each section of
pulp, just inside the separating membrane, when you can remove
the pure pulp. Serve in glass sauce-dish, or in cups,&mdash;orange,
glass or china.</p>

<p>Another dainty and satisfactory way of preparing an orange is
to “cut two circles through the skin around the fruit about ½ in.
apart and half way between the two ends. Remove all the rind
except the half-inch band. Just over one of the natural separations
between the sections of the orange, cut the band with a
sharp knife. All the divisions may then be carefully separated
one from another, while all remain attached to the girdle of yellow
rind. Oranges may be laid in layers on a fruit plate, outstretched
upon the narrow piece of peeling, or they may, after
the several divisions have<!--TN: was 'heve'--> been carefully made, be closed together
again. A ribbon tied around the orange over the rind girdle will
preserve the spherical form and be very pretty and ornamental.
It is but the act of a moment to untie this ribbon, when the
sections will all lie before one in perfect readiness to be eaten.”&mdash;<cite>Clipping.</cite></p>


<h4>PEACHES</h4>

<p>Ripe mellow peaches are incomparable both for health and
palatability. They are equally good both for grown people and
children, though one writer says “the ripe mellow peach is really
the child’s fruit.”</p>

<p>A friend fold me that an old Indian came to the house when
her little brother was lying at the point of death, and said,
“peach juice will keep him alive.” The mother, anxious to
<a id="Page_43" class="pagenum" title="43"> </a>
leave nothing untried, began giving him the juice of stewed
peaches, from which time he began to retain his food (the mother’s
milk) and to improve in every way. When he came to be
weaned, peach juice and gradually the soft halves of peaches
were his sole diet for eight months; then other foods were introduced
sparingly, but all his life peaches have formed a large part
of his diet and he is an unusually well man.</p>

<p>Wash and carefully rub peaches in cold water, and rub them
well with a soft cloth in wiping to remove the down, which is
irritating.</p>

<p>Peaches should ripen on the trees; the shipped ones are often
suitable for cooking only as they are gathered before they are
ripe. Some varieties are sour and disagreeable, while others are
sweet and luscious.</p>

<p>Few people know how exceedingly delightful rich juicy white
peaches are.</p>


<h5>PEACHES AND CREAM</h5>

<p>Pare peaches just as short a time before they are to be served
as possible. Cut in halves, quarters or thick slices. Do not
sweeten but pass sugar and unwhipped cream with them. Almond
or cocoanut cream are especially suitable for peaches.</p>


<h5>PEACH SNOW</h5>

<p>Add sweetened cream to stiffly-beaten whites of eggs (⅓ cup
to each white) and pour over peaches just before serving. All
must be cold.</p>

<p>Peaches combine nicely with bananas and with red raspberries.
The juice of the berries may be served over the peaches instead
of cream.</p>


<h4>PINEAPPLES</h4>

<p>The pineapple is another of the universal favorites and deservedly.
Its delightful flavor is unequaled and the fresh juice
contains bromelin, a remarkably active principle which aids digestion
both in the stomach and in the intestinal tract. A slice
<a id="Page_44" class="pagenum" title="44"> </a>
or two of pineapple taken at the close of a meal gives a marked
laxative effect. The use of pineapple in diphtheria<!--TN: was 'diptheria'--> is well known.
I knew a very successful physician in one of our large cities who
always had quantities of pineapple canned each year for use in
diphtheria cases. The digestive ferment is not quite so active
in the cooked fruit as in the uncooked.</p>


<h5>SHREDDED PINEAPPLE</h5>

<p>Use only choice large well ripened sound pineapples. Wash
and drain; give the crown a twist with the hand, when it will
come out easily if the fruit is ripe. Set the pineapple on a board
and with a large sharp knife pare it by cutting slices down from
the top all around, cut thick enough to remove all the woody
covering (the fruit in connection with that has very little flavor),
leaving only the deepest eyes.</p>

<p>After removing the eyes, take the pineapple in the left hand
with the base up and shred it by picking up small pieces all around
with the tines of a silver fork. It will come off easily from that
end, leaving the core, which should be wrung to obtain all the
juice.</p>

<p>Let the fruit stand in layers with sugar, ¼ to ½ cup, (or ¼
to ⅓ cup sugar, ½ to 1 tablespn. lemon juice and ¾ cup water)
to each pint, for some time before serving, or, serve plain and
pass sugar with it. Pineapple and strawberries or raspberries or
oranges with lemon juice and sugar are nice alone, or with cake,
for dessert.</p>


<h5>PINEAPPLE AND GRAPE FRUIT</h5>

<p>Equal quantities of prepared pineapple and grape fruit with
sugar and the juice of either poured over.</p>

<p>Peach, orange and pineapple is another nice combination.</p>


<h5>PINEAPPLE AND WHIPPED CREAM</h5>

<p>Drain finely-shredded pineapple and beat with whipped cream,
as much as can be used and keep the combination stiff. Serve
cold in glasses.</p>


<h5><a id="Page_45" class="pagenum" title="45"> </a>
PINEAPPLE AND STRAWBERRY AMBROSIA</h5>

<p>Equal quantities ripe strawberries, shredded pineapple and
cream. Whip cream, place layer of pineapple in dish, sprinkle
with sugar, cover with cream, then make a layer of strawberries,
sugar and cream. Continue. Have cream on top. Serve cold
with sponge cake or cocoanut crisps.</p>


<h5>PINEAPPLE AND ORANGE AMBROSIA</h5>

<p>Drained shredded pineapple, orange pulp and juice, grated
cocoanut and sugar, in layers.</p>


<h4>RAISINS</h4>

<p>Raisins are nutritious and valuable foods, containing sometimes
as high as 61 per cent. of grape sugar and a considerable
proportion of albuminoids. They are suitably combined with all
kinds of bread and nuts. One thing that makes them so satisfying
is that they require thorough mastication.</p>


<h4>RASPBERRIES&mdash;RED</h4>

<p>When necessary to wash, have cold water in a deep pan and
turn the berries in, not more than a quart at a time. (Do not
pour the water over the berries as that bruises them.) Rinse up
and down in the water with the hands and remove quickly to a
colander. Drain, pile in dish and serve at once. Lemon or
currant juice poured over makes a harmonious combination. ⅓
or ½ very ripe currants may be mixed with the berries. Serve
Brazil nuts or blanched almonds with these combinations.</p>


<h4>RASPBERRIES&mdash;BLACK</h4>

<p>Black raspberries have a peculiar spicy flavor not found in any
other fruit and when plump and thoroughly ripened may be used
in moderate quantities in their natural state.</p>


<h4>STRAWBERRIES</h4>

<p>The perfect way to serve strawberries is the French&mdash;with the
hulls on, without washing. Pass sugar with them, or pile the
berries around a mold of sugar on individual plates, or, set a dainty
<a id="Page_46" class="pagenum" title="46"> </a>
cup or glass containing sugar in the center of the plate and pile
the berries around. But if the berries are very sandy, wash the
same as red raspberries. Wash berries always before hulling unless
obliged to let stand after hulling, then do not wash until
just ready to serve. The little strawberry hullers snip the hulls
out so quickly and so perfectly without staining the fingers that
they seem among the indispensables of housekeeping.</p>


<h5>ORANGE STRAWBERRIES</h5>

<p>Put sliced berries into glasses and pour sweetened orange juice
over to more than cover. Let stand in a cool place 3 or 4 hrs.
to improve the color. They may be served with an uncooked
meringue garnished with halves or quarters of berries or a slice
of orange.</p>


<h4>WATERMELON</h4>

<p>The flavor of watermelon is better if cooled in water instead
of on ice. To serve cut the melon in halves across and cut off
pieces from the ends so that they will stand. Serve the pulp by
spoonfuls, scooped out with a tablespoon. If convenient take
the pieces out before sending to the table, remove the seeds and
return the pieces to the shell, then keep in a cool place until
serving time.</p>

<p>The watermelon furnishes an abundance of pure distilled water.
Watermelons that are not very sweet maybe served with almond
cream and sugar.</p>


<h4>WHORTLEBERRIES</h4>

<p>The most desirable of this family is the large purple soft pulpy
sweet juicy berry growing in the swamps, and called in some
parts of the country “blueberry.” It is delightful with nut or
dairy cream or with sugar or in bread and milk. Its juice being
so sweet it is one of the most suitable berries for sauce with
cereals. In cakes puddings or pies it is equally enjoyable.</p>

<p>The so-called “huckleberry,” though more seedy, has a nice
flavor when cooked.</p>


<h3 id="COOKED"><a id="Page_47" class="pagenum" title="47"> </a>
FRUITS&mdash;COOKED</h3>


<h4>APPLE SAUCE</h4>

<p>Select nice tart apples; wash, drain, cut out the blossom end of
each so that the little black particles will not get on to the fruit.
Pare as thin as possible. When all are pared, cut into quarters,
and core by cutting from both stem and blossom end downward
to the center, just below the core. After coring, throw
enough quarters into the kettle (granite, porcelain or aluminum)
to about cover the bottom, and turn the quarters core side down.
Then arrange another layer in the same way and continue until
all are in. Pour boiling water over to half cover the apples
(more or less according to the juiciness of the apples), cover kettle
and set over hot fire. Cook without removing cover until
apples are perfectly tender; remove from fire at once, stir in a
little sugar if desired and a trifle of salt. This method gives a
nice white well cooked sauce with a fresh apple taste. Placing
the apples as directed causes them to cook tender quickly and
evenly. The salt improves the flavor unless too much is used.</p>


<h5>STRAINED APPLE SAUCE</h5>

<p>When apples are small or knotty, cook without paring, rub
through colander and add a little sugar.</p>


<h5>BAKED APPLE SAUCE</h5>

<p>Place quartered apples in pudding dish as for apple sauce.
Sprinkle delicately with sugar between the layers and over the
top. Pour water in at the side of the dish so as to leave the
sugar on the top. Cover and bake for several hours until the
apples assume a rich red color.</p>


<h4>BAKED QUARTERS OF APPLES</h4>

<p>Wash, quarter and core but do not pare apples; lay cut side
down in pudding dish, pour very little if any water over, cover
close, bake until tender. Remove cover and dry out well. Eat
from the fingers, rejecting the skins, or scrape the pulp from the
<a id="Page_48" class="pagenum" title="48"> </a>
skin with a teaspoon. The skin imparts such richness and flavor
to the pulp that it seems to have been sweetened with sugar.</p>


<h4>BAKED APPLES</h4>

<p>To the natural taste, the apple is best just washed, put into a
baking pan with little if any water (depending upon the juiciness
of the apple), covered at first and baked until tender and
dry. Some prefer to have the apples cored with ½&ndash;1 teaspn. of
sugar (brown sugar sometimes) placed in the core space.</p>


<h4>LEMON APPLES, ORANGE APPLES, AND OTHERS</h4>

<p>Core and pare nice large perfect apples. Place in the core
space sugar with a little grated lemon or orange rind. Sprinkle
outside of apples with sugar and turn a little lemon juice over
for “Lemon Apples” or “Orange Apples.” Bake until just tender,
with or without a little water.</p>

<p>Use citron, cocoanut, raisins or nuts with sugar for other
varieties. Fill core space with jelly for “Jelly Apples.” Serve
plain or with nut cream or whipped dairy cream, or with cocoanut
or custard sauce or with wafers or nuts for dessert, at a meal
without vegetables, especially starchy vegetables.</p>

<p>Lemon and jelly apples make suitable accompaniments to
meat dishes.</p>


<h4>BAKED SWEET APPLES</h4>

<p>Bake whole with plenty of water at first (covered part of the
time) until perfectly tender and all the water is evaporated.
Serve for dessert, or for breakfast or supper with nuts, or with
nut or dairy cream, or in bread and milk, than which nothing is
more delicious.</p>


<h4>“MOTHER” CRANSON’S STEWED SWEET APPLES</h4>

<p>Put whole apples into preserving kettle, cover with thin syrup
of sugar and water and cook until tender (carefully changing the
apples from top to bottom once or twice) and the syrup just a
little thick. Place the apples on plates and turn the syrup over.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_49" class="pagenum" title="49"> </a>
STEWED BANANAS</h4>

<p>Slice bananas, stew with a little sugar water and a trifle of
ground or crushed anise seed tied in a piece of cheese cloth.</p>

<p>Prunes may be flavored the same.</p>


<h4>BANANAS IN BUTTER</h4>

<p>Simmer bananas in butter in an aluminum or agate frying pan
covered, on the top of the stove where it is not too hot. They
will not be browned but simply stewed.</p>


<h4>BANANAS AND RAISINS</h4>

<p>Cook raisins in a broad flat pan in water for an hour. Slice
bananas over, cover and cook 10 m.</p>


<h4>BAKED BANANAS</h4>

<p>The simplest way to bake bananas is in the skins. It takes
just 20 m. in a moderate oven. To eat, strip a piece of skin
about an inch wide from the top side and partake of the baked
fruit from the remaining skin in teaspoonfuls.</p>

<p>Bananas may be baked whole with a little water after peeling,
and served with orange or cream sauce.</p>

<p>A little melted butter may be poured over bananas before baking
or they may be rolled in lemon juice and sugar and baked. For
a richer dish, turn mixed melted butter, sugar and lemon juice
over bananas in lengthwise halves in agate pan. Bake 15&ndash;20 m.
in slow oven. Serve with meat dishes sometimes.</p>


<h4>BAKED CRUMBED BANANAS</h4>

<p>Roll peeled bananas in fine granella, cracker or zwieback
crumbs mixed with sugar. Bake in moderate oven till just tender.
Serve at once.</p>

<h4>BANANAS BAKED WITH TOMATOES</h4>

<p>Put a thin layer of stewed or sliced tomatoes in the bottom of
a baking pan. Cover with bananas sliced crosswise. Bake.</p>

<h4>CRANBERRIES</h4>

<p>Cranberries are said to “promote digestion and purify the
<a id="Page_50" class="pagenum" title="50"> </a>
blood.” There is no question but they are a desirable fruit and
should be used freely in their season.</p>

<h5>Stewed Cranberries</h5>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. berries,</li>
  <li>¾ cup sugar,</li>
  <li>1&ndash;1½ cup water.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pour boiling water over cranberries, let stand 2 m., or until
cold; drain, add sugar and water, cook covered, until boiling all
through. Rub through colander if the skins are objectionable.
2&ndash;3 tablespns. of lemon juice and more sugar may be added.</p>

<h5>Baked Cranberries.</h5>

<p>Make syrup of 1 pt. of water and 1½ cup of sugar; boil, cool.
Pour over 1 qt. of cranberries in baking dish. Bake until clear.</p>

<h5>Cranberries With Raisins</h5>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. berries</li>
  <li>¾&ndash;1 cup seeded raisins</li>
  <li>1 cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 pint water</li>
</ul>

<p>Stew raisins in water until nearly tender; pour boiling water
over cranberries and drain; cook all together until berries are
done.</p>

<p>A larger proportion of raisins and less sugar may be used.</p>

<h4>BAKED PEACHES</h4>

<p>Whole, pared, cling-stone peaches; sugar, butter and lemon
juice. Bake 40 m. May be served with meat dishes, or as
dessert.</p>

<h4>BAKED QUINCES&mdash;Delicious</h4>

<p>Wash, pare, halve, core. (Save skins and cores for jelly).
Cover with a large quantity of thin sugar and water syrup. Bake
covered, basting often and turning occasionally until tender and
the syrup rich. Uncover at the last for a short time.</p>

<h5>PLAIN BAKED QUINCES</h5>

<p>Pare and core quinces, bake with water only, basting. Serve
with hard or creamy sauce or with nut cream and sugar.</p>

<h4>RHUBARB</h4>

<p>Rhubarb is not a fruit but the stalk of the plant and as its acid
<a id="Page_51" class="pagenum" title="51"> </a>
is oxalic, it is a somewhat questionable article of diet. At all
events it should not be used freely.</p>

<h5>Stewed Rhubarb</h5>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. rhubarb</li>
  <li>½ cup sugar</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash rhubarb, do not peel, cut into ¾ in. pieces; cook with
sugar, on the back of the stove until juicy; then stew till tender.</p>

<h5>Stewed Rhubarb, No.&nbsp;2</h5>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. rhubarb</li>
  <li>scant ⅔ cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. lemon juice</li>
  <li>¼ cup water</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook all together.</p>

<h5>Baked Rhubarb</h5>

<p>Put rhubarb in baking dish with sugar and lemon juice as for
stewing, with or without a little water. Cover and bake until
tender.</p>

<p>It is said that if young cherry leaves are scalded and the juice
added to cooked rhubarb, it will impart the flavor of cherries to
the rhubarb.</p>

<h4>STEWED DRIED FRUITS</h4>

<p>The flavors of dried fruits are more natural and delicate with
prolonged soaking and short (if any) cooking. Choice dried apples
and apricots are especially enjoyable soaked over night or
longer without any cooking. The juice from them makes an
exceedingly refreshing drink.</p>

<p>Pour boiling water over fruit that requires washing to more
perfectly loosen the dirt, then quickly add cold water. Wash
thoroughly, cover with warm water and let stand for from 12 to
48 hrs. When perfectly swollen and soft, add sugar, if it is to
be used, bring to the boiling point quickly and remove from the
fire. These directions if followed will cause apples, apricots and
peaches to seem almost like fresh stewed fruit.</p>

<p>A few fresh grapes stewed with peaches give them a nice flavor.</p>

<p>Raisins also (previously cooked) are nice with dried peaches.</p>

<p><a id="Page_52" class="pagenum" title="52"> </a>
The most delightful combination with dried apples is ⅓ prunelles.
Raisins are also nice with apples.</p>

<h5>Stewed Dried Apricots</h5>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½ lb. apricots</li>
  <li>3½ cups water</li>
  <li>½ cup sugar</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow general directions.</p>

<h4>PRUNES&mdash;SWEET CALIFORNIA</h4>

<p>These require no sugar but will bear a little longer cooking
than peaches and apricots.</p>

<p>¾ prunes and ¼ apricots make a nice combination, also
raisins or figs and prunes.</p>

<h5>Prune Marmalade</h5>

<p>Cook prunes with a small amount of water and rub through
colander. This removes the skins or breaks them up so that
many can take them who otherwise could not. Served with
almonds, beaten white of egg or almond or whipped cream, the
marmalade makes a nice dessert.</p>

<h5>Steamed Prunes&mdash;par excellence</h5>

<p>Soak large prunes in a very little water, stirring occasionally
so that all will be moistened. Steam ¾ of an hour. Cover as
soon as removed from the steamer. Serve warm for breakfast.
They may be steamed an hour without soaking.</p>

<h4>Stewed Figs</h4>

<p>Wash, soak, cook until tender, reduce liquor to syrup and
pour over fruit. Serve with wafers or nuts or with whipped
cream flavored with vanilla or almond.</p>

<h5>Steamed Figs&mdash;best of all</h5>

<p>Wash figs and steam 25&ndash;35 m. according to dryness. Long
steaming gives them a strong flavor. Cover, and serve warm.
The figs may be soaked the same as prunes before steaming.</p>

<h4>Fruit Butter</h4>

<p>Stew together 1½ lb. prunes and 1 lb. of dried apricots, no
<a id="Page_53" class="pagenum" title="53"> </a>
sugar. Rub through colander and cook to the consistency of
butter.</p>


<h3 id="TO_CAN_FRUITS">TO CAN FRUITS</h3>

<h4>Suggestions</h4>

<p>The best quality of aluminum is the ideal material for the
preserving kettle; but granite, porcelain or earthenware may be
used.</p>

<p>Thorough sterilization of the jars or cans is one of the most
important parts of fruit canning. I always wash and sterilize
mine when I empty them.</p>

<p>After washing the covers of Mason jars, bake them in a moderate
oven for 2 or 3 hours; scrape them on the inside if necessary
but do not wet them, and screw them on to the jars, which
should have been well washed, scalded, wiped with a clean
towel and thoroughly dried by standing right side up in a warm
place.</p>

<p>The rubbers should be put on when the covers are, so that the
jars will be all ready for use.</p>

<p>When old rubbers are in good condition they are just as good
as new ones. Sometimes two thin ones may be used together.</p>

<p>There is a certain black rubber that should not be used with
delicate flavored fruits as it injures their flavor. It does not improve
the flavor of any fruit.</p>

<p>New rubbers should be washed and rubbed well in soapsuds
and rinsed before using.</p>

<p>Keep the jars in a dry place and when you come to use them
turn them over once in a pan of boiling water, scalding the covers
the same.</p>

<p>Do not waste time, strength, jars or sugar on imperfect, decayed
or unripe fruit. The probabilities are that it will not keep;
and if it does the appearance and flavor will be inferior.</p>

<p>Put the fruit into the jars <em>boiling hot</em> and seal immediately. Do
<a id="Page_54" class="pagenum" title="54"> </a>
not try to remove the froth or air bubbles (pure air will do no harm
in cans, and it will be pure when the fruit is at boiling heat all
around it and will remain so if the can is well sealed), because
while you are trying to let the air out the fruit is cooling on top
and the germs from the outside air are settling upon it.</p>

<p>If the fruit gets below the boiling point while filling the jars,
return it to the fire and reheat it. <em>Fill the jars to overflowing.</em>
Fasten the covers on perfectly tight, press the edges down all
around into the rubber of Mason jars, if inclined to leak. Do
not tighten the covers after the fruit is cold.</p>

<p>With Lightning jars it is sometimes necessary to slip little
splinters of wood (bits of berry boxes) under the wires to make
the covers tight enough.</p>

<p>When the covers are perfectly adjusted, invert the jars and
leave them until cool. This not only shows whether any are
leaking or not but fills any spaces there may be.</p>

<p>Keep canned fruit in a dark place. The light will cause it to
lose its flavor as well as color. Wrap jars in paper if necessary.</p>

<p>The simplest way to fill jars is to set them in a row on a towel
wrung out of cold water and folded so that it is thick. The jars
must be cold also. Or, the towel may be wrung out of hot water
and the jars rinsed in hot water before filling. In either case
have the covers warm.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that “sugar, when largely used, is more injurious
than meat.”</p>

<p>Some fruits, rich fine-flavored pears and peaches, whortleberries
and others are excellent canned without sugar. They taste
more like fresh fruit.</p>

<p>I always can whortleberries without water, so as to have them
for pies. For sauce, water may be added after they are opened.</p>

<p>Gooseberries canned without water or sugar make delightful,
fresh tasting pies in winter.</p>

<p>Never fail to secure black currants if possible for pies.</p>

<p><a id="Page_55" class="pagenum" title="55"> </a>
Always label fruit before putting it away, giving the year in
which it was put up.</p>

<p>Canned fruits and vegetables should be opened two hours or
more before serving, to give the fresh taste which comes with
the restoration of oxygen.</p>

<p>There is much work at the best connected with fruit canning,
so I have tried to simplify it as much as possible. The methods
given here are those which I have used for years with good
results.</p>


<h4>TO CAN SOLID BERRIES</h4>

<p>Cherries, whortleberries, red and black currants and all berries
that do not crush easily may be put into the kettle in layers
with sugar (never more than ½ pt. of sugar to 2 qts. of fresh
fruit and usually less), brought to the boiling point slowly and
put into jars with very little trouble. The following is an average
proportion of sugar and water to use with this class of berries:</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>Blackberries&mdash;2 qts. berries, ½&ndash;¾ cup sugar, 2 cups water.</li>

  <li>Blk. Raspberries&mdash;2 qts. berries, ½&ndash;¾ cup sugar, 2 cups water.</li>

  <li>Gooseberries<!--TN: was 'Gooseberrries'-->, green&mdash;2 qts. berries, 1&ndash;1½ cup sugar, 4 cups
  water.</li>

  <li>Gooseberries, ripe&mdash;2 qts. berries, 1&ndash;1½ cup sugar, 1&ndash;1½ cup
  water.</li>

  <li>Whortleberries,&mdash;2 qts. berries, ½ cup sugar (if any), 1 tablespn.
  water.</li>

  <li>Rhubarb&mdash;1 qt. rhubarb in ¾ in. lengths, ½ cup sugar, no water.</li>
</ul>


<h4>TO CAN PEACHES AND FRUITS OF THAT CLASS</h4>

<h5>Peaches</h5>

<p>Wash peaches, rubbing well, drain, pare as thin as possible
and drop into cold water to keep them from turning dark. If
the peaches are very ripe, put a few at a time into a wire basket
and plunge into boiling water. Hold them there a moment,
then quickly turn them into cold water; after which the skins
will slip off easily.</p>

<p><a id="Page_56" class="pagenum" title="56"> </a>
This is a quicker method and does not waste the peaches, but I
have thought they were more apt to turn dark.</p>

<p>For each rounded quart of peaches, make a syrup of ⅓&ndash;½ cup
of sugar and 1&ndash;1½ cup of water, the water in which the peaches
were standing. Bring the syrup to the boiling point, drop the
peaches in (if in halves the cut side down), boil until thoroughly
heated through, or until tender; drop the peaches into the jars,
pour boiling syrup over, seal, following “Suggestions” carefully.</p>


<h5>Pears</h5>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 rounded qt. (8 or 9) pears in halves</li>
  <li>⅓&ndash;½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. lemon juice</li>
  <li>1&ndash;1½ cup water</li>
</ul>

<p>Finish the same as peaches.</p>

<p>The lemon juice gives character to the pears.</p>

<p>I once had some pears that were so flavorless it seemed hardly
worth while to can them, but I tied ground anise seed in small
pieces of cheese cloth and cooked with them, besides adding
lemon juice, and they were excellent. Small pears and those
with thin skins may be canned without paring. They are richer
but the skins sometimes cause flatulence.</p>

<p>Do not can pears while they are hard.</p>


<h5>Plums</h5>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. plums</li>
  <li>¼&ndash;⅓ cup sugar</li>
  <li>¼&ndash;½ cup water</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a good plan to prick the plums on all sides with a fork
before cooking.</p>


<h5>Quinces and Sweet Apples</h5>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>6 qts. quinces in eighths</li>
  <li>6 qts. sweet apples in quarters</li>
  <li>5 qts. water</li>
  <li>4&ndash;6 cups sugar</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook quinces in water until tender, remove with skimmer;
cook apples in same water, remove apples, measure water, adding
more if necessary; dissolve sugar in water, heat to boiling, add
fruit, simmer a few minutes and put into jars.</p>

<p>Quinces are much improved by combining with sweet apples.
<a id="Page_57" class="pagenum" title="57"> </a>
When the apples are cooked with them, the quinces become
more tender.</p>

<p>Quinces and citron and quinces and pears may also be combined.</p>


<h5>Cranberries and Sweet Apples</h5>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. cranberries</li>
  <li>1½ qt. sweet apples in quarters</li>
  <li>⅔ qt. cold water</li>
  <li>¾&ndash;1 cup sugar</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook sugar, water and cranberries together, until the cranberries
begin to crack; add the apples and cook all slowly until
the apples are soft. Put into jars and seal.</p>


<h4>To Can Strawberries</h4>

<div class="subtitle">
Also red raspberries and all delicate berries.
</div>

<p>For each 2 qts. of hulled berries (just enough to fill one quart
jar), use 1 cup of granulated sugar. Put a layer of berries into
an earthen or granite ware dish, sprinkle with sugar, cover with
another layer of berries and so on. (Strawberries are so juicy
they will not bear any water). Let berries and sugar stand together
in the ice box or cellar for several hours. They may be
prepared late in the afternoon and put into the jars the first
thing the next morning.</p>

<p>When ready to can the fruit, drain off the juice, heat it to
boiling, turn the berries carefully into it and shake and turn the
dish once in a while to keep the fruit heating evenly. When
just boiling all through, dip carefully into cans with a handled
cup. Put the covers on quickly, no matter how many bubbles
of air there are nor how much froth there is in the jars, and screw
down tight with a can opener. After pressing the edge of the
covers down if necessary<!--TN: was 'neccessary'-->, lay the jars on the side (instead of
inverting, for strawberries) and turn over occasionally while
cooling.</p>

<p>When perfectly cold, set jars upright and you will find the
berries evenly distributed through the jars and they will never
rise to the top.</p>

<p><a id="Page_58" class="pagenum" title="58"> </a>
Allowing the berries to stand in sugar and afterwards putting
them into boiling syrup hardens them so that they keep their
shape. It is better to heat just enough at once to fill each jar. You
can have several dishes (milk crocks, granite, porcelain and aluminum
kettles) on the stove at once at different stages of heating
so that you can fill one jar after another.</p>

<p>This was my auntie’s method and I have never seen it excelled.</p>


<h4>Pineapple</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>¼&ndash;⅓ cup sugar</li>
  <li>½&ndash;1 tablespn. lemon juice</li>
  <li>¾ cup water</li>
  <li>1 pt. pineapple</li>
</ul>

<p>Prepare pineapple as for fresh pineapple, put into stone jars or
earthen vessels with layers of sugar; stand in ice box a few hours
(not long enough to ferment), drain off the juice, add lemon juice
and water, heat to boiling, add fruit. Let all just boil up, fill
jars, seal as other fruits. The delicate flavor of pineapple is
lost by long cooking.</p>

<p>Grated pineapple canned with ½ cup of sugar to the quart is
suitable for ices and other uses.</p>


<h4>Rhubarb&mdash;cooked</h4>

<p>Put stewed rhubarb into jars as soon as it boils up well.</p>


<h4>Rhubarb Without Cooking&mdash;for pies</h4>

<div class="subtitle">
A reliable method which gives the natural flavor.
</div>

<p>Wash rhubarb and cut into inch pieces without peeling, pour
boiling water over, drain at once, cool, pack in cans and fill with
boiled, strained, ice-cold water. Seal cans, invert in cold place
and cover from the light. Set upright after a few hours. To
use, drain, let stand in fresh cold water ½ hour and drain again.</p>

<p>Cranberries may be canned in the same way.</p>


<h4>Watermelon Rind or Citron</h4>

<p>Pare off the thin green rind, cut into pieces 1 in. square, or
into strips, stand in cold water for two or three hours, changing
<a id="Page_59" class="pagenum" title="59"> </a>
the water occasionally; drain thoroughly, make syrup of 1 pt.
water to 1 or 1½ pt. sugar, according to the richness desired.
(3 or 4 tablespns. of lemon juice may be used with the larger
quantity of sugar). When syrup is boiling, add rind, simmer
until pieces can be pierced easily with a broom straw, or until
they are clear, put into jars and seal.</p>

<p>One part raisins to five or six of the rind gives a nice flavor.
Or, orange flowers, rose leaves or rose water may be used, but
the fruit is nice without any flavoring.</p>

<p>Green melons which did not have time to ripen before the
frost, are excellent prepared in this way.</p>

<p>The rind may be steamed before putting it into the syrup,
and less water used for the syrup.</p>


<h4>Concord Grapes</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 qts. grapes</li>
  <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
  <li>½ cup water</li>
</ul>

<p>Pulp the grapes, run skins through the food cutter and cook
for 20 m. in the water. Boil pulp until tender and rub through
colander to remove the seeds. Add pulp and sugar to skins, heat
to boiling and put into jars. The juice may be strained from
the pulp and used to cook the skins in.</p>


<h4>Barberries</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. berries</li>
  <li>2 cups sugar</li>
  <li>½&ndash;1 cup water</li>
</ul>

<p>Very nice for garnishing fruit salads, desserts or cakes.</p>


<h4>Tomatoes</h4>

<p>Select only perfectly fresh, well ripened tomatoes, wash and
drop into kettle of boiling water, remove with skimmer, drop
into cold water, peel, leave whole or slice. Boil well and put
into jars the same as other fruit. Long boiling frees the acid
and takes away the fresh, delicate flavor. When tomatoes are
very watery, drain off some of the liquid and can it separately
for use in soups and broths.</p>


<h5><a id="Page_60" class="pagenum" title="60"> </a>
Tomatoes for Soups and Sauces</h5>

<p>Wash and slice tomatoes without peeling. Heat to boiling,
rub through fine colander or sieve to remove skins and seeds.
Reheat and put into jars.</p>


<h5>Whole Tomatoes</h5>

<p>Pack peeled or unpeeled tomatoes in wide-mouthed jars.
Cook a few nice ripe tomatoes, strain and pour the liquid,
cold, over tomatoes in jars, seal, set jars in cold water as in canning
vegetables, bring slowly to boiling point and boil ½ hour.
Remove from water, tighten covers and invert jars as usual.</p>


<h4>FRUIT JUICES</h4>

<p>Begin with the earliest fruits and can some of the juice of
each kind through the summer until you come to grapes and
apples in the autumn. When diluted with water, these juices
are delightful beverages for sick or well. A little lemon juice
gives character to the drink. Without diluting, they make nice
flavorings for fruit salads, egg creams and pudding sauces. Blueberry,
black raspberry and other sweet juices make excellent
dressings for grains instead of milk or cream.</p>


<h5>Grape Juice</h5>

<p>Concords or some of the dark purple grapes are the richest
and most satisfactory for juice. Pick the grapes from the stems,
wash and drain, put into a preserving kettle without water, cover
and put on back of stove on an asbestos pad or a ring so they
will heat slowly. When the skins are broken and the juice is
free, bring just to the boiling point, put into jelly bags and drain
without squeezing. To each quart of juice add from ½ to 1 cup
of sugar. Very ripe grapes will require no sugar. Heat to boiling
and can the same as fruit.</p>

<p>Add more water to the pulp that is left in the jelly bag, reheat,
strain, boil and put into large jars for a drink, or, rub the pulp
through a colander, sweeten, heat and can for marmalade.</p>

<p><a id="Page_61" class="pagenum" title="61"> </a>
<i>To Bottle Juices</i>&mdash;Nearly fill bottles, standing on cloth wrung
out of cold water, with boiling juice, through hot funnel. Press
clean cork into bottle, cut off even with the top of the bottle
and cover immediately with sealing wax made by melting together
resin and oil. Use only enough oil to make the resin soft enough
to spread over the cork and around the edges of the bottle. If
too soft, the wax will run off.</p>


<h5>Condensed Fruit Juices</h5>

<p>Cook apple and other fruit juices rapidly until thick, then
simmer slowly over the fire or in the oven until as thick as desired.
Seal in jars or put into glasses or cups as jelly. Convenient
for travelling, diluted.</p>


<h4>APPLES</h4>

<p>When apples are plentiful or likely to spoil, make into any of
the apple sauces, put hot into jars and seal.</p>


<h5>Baked Apples</h5>

<p>Bake unpared apples, sweet or sour, in halves or quarters,
leaving them rather juicy, put into jars and seal. On opening,
put apples into oven in baking dish and dry out a little more.</p>


<h4>Combinations of Fruits for Canning</h4>

<p>Red or black raspberries with currant juice.</p>

<p>Red or black raspberries with cherries.</p>

<p>Plums with sweet apples.</p>

<p>Currants or currant juice with pineapple.</p>

<p>Orange, strawberry and pineapple juices with sugar, for strawberries
and pineapple canned together, or for pineapple alone.</p>

<p>Strawberries with pineapple.</p>

<p>Pears and barberries. Cook barberries in water, rub through
colander, add sugar, 1&ndash;1½ cup to the pint of pulp. Return to
the fire and when hot, lay in halves or quarters of nice ripe
pears. Cook until pears are tender. If the pears are not quite
<a id="Page_62" class="pagenum" title="62"> </a>
soft, steam, or cook in pulp without sugar first. Sweet apples
may be used instead of pears.</p>


<h3 id="JELLIES">JELLIES</h3>

<p>Because of the large proportion of sugar required in jellies it
is not best to use them freely.</p>

<p>Fruit for jelly should always be a little underripe and should
not be picked just after a rain. Combine the juices of such fruits
as do not jelly easily, or of the more expensive fruits, with apple
juice which jellies the easiest of all. With strong flavored fruits,
apple makes the jelly more agreeable. Jellies may be made in
the winter of canned fruit juices and the juice from apple skins
and cores. The addition of lemon juice to sweet fruits will convert
them into jelly-making products. A few pieces of rose
geranium leaves dropped into apple jelly just before putting it
into glasses and removed in a minute, give the jelly a nice flavor.</p>

<p>Always boil the juice the required length of time before adding
the sugar. It requires longer boiling on damp days.</p>

<p>Heat sugar in flat pan in oven before adding to jelly.</p>

<p>Thorough straining is necessary to make clear jelly. For the
finest jelly, use first a double thickness of mosquito netting; then
the same of cheese cloth, and lastly, one thickness of flannel.</p>

<p>Wet the cloth before putting the fruit in, to save the waste
of juice. Hang in a warm place to drain.</p>

<p>It is said that if a little jelly dropped into cold water falls immediately
to the bottom, the jelly is done; or, if it jellies on the
spoon it is done.</p>

<p>Glasses for jelly may be set cold on a cold cloth, or warm on
a warm cloth. Fill to the brim, as the jelly shrinks.</p>

<p>When the jelly is soft, set in the sun for a day or two, covered
with panes of glass. When ready to set away, turn hot
melted paraffine over the jelly. The heat destroys any germs
which may have settled on the top. Cover with paper or with
<a id="Page_63" class="pagenum" title="63"> </a>
tin covers and set in a dark place. When using the jelly, wash
and save the paraffine.</p>

<p>If jelly is to be moved or shipped, use a covering of ¼ inch
of powdered sugar instead of the paraffine.</p>

<p>Or, cut rounds of toilet paper, two for each glass, large enough
to overlap an inch; dip one at a time into a saucer of cold boiled
milk, cover glass and press down, then put on the second piece
quickly.</p>

<p>One thickness of Manila paper may be used instead of the
toilet paper. When dry, a thick parchment-like cover will be
formed and the jelly will keep well. Some housewives cover
jelly while hot, thinking it keeps better.</p>


<h4>To Make Jelly Tumblers</h4>

<p>Soak a cord in turpentine, tie it tight around bottles and
set fire to the cord.</p>


<h4>Currant Jelly</h4>

<p>Wash and drain currants. They are usually left on the stems
but strain more easily if stemmed. Crush the berries, a few at
a time and throw into the preserving kettle. Do not add any
water. Set on back of range and heat slowly to nearly, not
quite, boiling. Strain, measure juice, return to kettle and set
over fire. At the same time put into a moderate oven in broad
bottomed pans, sugar in the proportion of ¾&ndash;1 pt. to each pint
of juice (¾ is sufficient). After juice begins to boil, boil 20 m.,
skimming as the scum rises. Add hot sugar, stir until sugar is
dissolved, remove from fire and put at once into glasses.</p>

<p>⅓ white currants may be used with red.</p>

<p>A thinner jelly to be used with meats and over puddings underneath
the meringue, may be made with<!--TN: was 'wit'--> ½ pt. of sugar to the
pint of juice.</p>

<p>A little celery salt may be added when jelly is to be used with
meats.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_64" class="pagenum" title="64"> </a>
Currant and Raspberry Jelly</h4>

<p>⅔ currant juice and ⅓ raspberry or ⅓ currant and ⅔ raspberry
makes a delightful combination.</p>


<h4>Black Currant Jelly</h4>

<p>Prepare stemmed currants as for red currant jelly. Use ¼ to
½ cup of water to each quart of currants and ¾ pt. of sugar to
a pint of juice. 10 m. boiling is sufficient.</p>

<p>½ or ⅔ apple juice will make a more delicate flavored jelly.</p>


<h4>Jelly of Apple Parings and Cores</h4>

<p>Measure skins and cores by pressing firmly into the measure.
Add ⅓ (no more) as much water as of fruit&mdash;you will think it
is not enough. Boil 20 m., stirring often. Strain. Measure
juice, boil 20&ndash;30 m., according to juiciness of apples, skimming.
Add ½ as much sugar, hot, as of juice, boil 5&ndash;10 m., or until
foamy. Put at once into glasses.</p>

<p>If apple jelly is as thick as desired when it first cools, it will
be too thick after standing a few days. If apples are very juicy,
use only one-half as much water.</p>


<h4>Apple Jelly</h4>

<p>Wash apples and cut into quarters or eighths. Do not pare or
core. Add ¼ as much water as of apples in the kettle. Cook,
stirring occasionally until apples are tender, not too soft. Finish
as in jelly of parings. It is difficult to give the exact time
for cooking, as apples vary in jellying properties. Use less water
if apples are very juicy. One quince to every 10 or 12 apples
gives a nice flavor. A few green grapes combined with apples
or crab apples make a nice jelly.</p>

<p>Crab and Baldwin apples may be combined.</p>


<h4>Apple and Cranberry Jelly</h4>

<p>Stew 1 qt. of apple parings with 1 cup of cranberries and a
pint of water until tender. Strain. There should be about ¾
<a id="Page_65" class="pagenum" title="65"> </a>
of a pint of juice. Boil 5 m.<!--TN: added period-->; add ¾ pt. sugar, boil 2&ndash;4 m. Or,
use 1 doz. large tart apples to 1 qt. of berries, or equal parts apple
and cranberry juice. Proceed as in other jellies.</p>


<h4>Elder-berry and Apple Jelly</h4>

<p>Cook elder-berries with ½ cup of water to each quart of berries.
Strain and combine with apple juice in the proportion of ⅓ elder-berry
juice to ⅔ apple juice. Use ¾&ndash;1 pt. of sugar to each pint
of juice. Finish as for currant jelly. Elder-berries alone make
a strong flavored jelly, but this combination is delightful.</p>

<p>Strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, cherries, wild cherries,
pineapple, barberries, peaches, plums and some other fruits, all
make better jelly by combining with apple juice in proportions
according to flavor. Use no water with any of the fruits but
the apple.</p>

<p>Currant juice may be combined with these fruits instead of
apple juice.</p>


<h4>Green Gooseberry Jelly</h4>

<p>2 qts. berries, ¾ qt. water; stew, mash, strain; boil 20 m.
for each quart of juice, add 1 qt. of hot sugar, boil 2&ndash;3 minutes.</p>


<h4>Quince Jelly</h4>

<p>Wash quinces, cut into quarters or eighths, remove part or all
of the seeds, use ⅓&ndash;½ as much water as of fruit and ½ as much
sugar as of juice. Cook and finish as apple jelly.</p>

<p>⅓&ndash;½ apple juice with quince is better.</p>


<h4>Cranberry Jelly</h4>

<p>Use one cup of water to each 4 qts. of cranberries; cook until
the berries are tender, strain and use equal quantities of sugar
and juice. Boil the juice 10&ndash;12 m., add the sugar hot, stir till it
is dissolved and turn the jelly into glasses or a mold. The jelly
may be molded in a shallow pan and when perfectly cold cut
into cubes.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_66" class="pagenum" title="66"> </a>
Jellied Cranberry Pulp</h4>

<p>Rub stewed cranberries in the preceding recipe through the
colander, boil 8 m., add sugar, stir carefully until dissolved, mold.</p>


<h4>Jellied Cranberry Sauce</h4>

<p>1 qt. berries, 1 pt. sugar, ½&ndash;1 cup water. Pour water over
berries with sugar, in kettle, cover, cook 10 m. without stirring.
Put into large or individual molds. Unmold at serving time.</p>


<h4>Blueberry Jelly</h4>

<p>If berries are very dry, add a little water, heat, strain; use
½&ndash;¾ as much sugar as of juice.</p>


<h4>Blueberry Jelly No.&nbsp;2</h4>

<p>4 qts. berries, 1 cup water; cook and strain, add 2 tablespns.
of lemon juice to each pint of juice. Cook 20 m., add ¾ as much
sugar, hot, as of juice, boil up well, pour into glasses.</p>


<h4>Grape Jelly</h4>

<p>Wild grapes are preferable, but underripe Concords, Catawbas,
and other varieties may be used.</p>

<p>Proceed as for currant jelly, using only ⅔ as much sugar as of
juice. If necessary, boil 5 m. after sugar is added. Use no
water with cultivated grapes, but with underripe wild grapes, ½
cup of water may be added to each quart of stemmed grapes.</p>


<h4 id="JAMS">Raspberry and Currant Jam</h4><!--TN: 'Jams' in ToC, but no separate heading in text-->

<p>Take ¾ their weight of sugar to berries. Mash berries in
kettle over fire, add 1 pt. currant juice to each 2 qts. of berries,
cook until thickened, 40&ndash;45 m., stirring and skimming, add sugar
hot, boil, put into glasses or seal in jars.</p>


<h4>Strawberry Jam</h4>

<p>Allow ¾ their weight of sugar to berries; cook in a little of
the sugar, stirring, 20&ndash;30 m. Add remainder of sugar hot, cook
10&ndash;20 m., if necessary. Small berries may be used for jam.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_67" class="pagenum" title="67"> </a>
Gooseberry Jam</h4>

<p>Press the juice from 3 oranges and shave off the rind, being
careful not to get any of the white part. Remove blossoms and
stems from 5 lbs. gooseberries, seed 2 lbs. of raisins, and chop
all together very fine. Add 3&ndash;4 lbs. sugar and the orange juice
and cook slowly for an hour. Turn into jars or tumblers and
when cold spread a layer of powdered sugar on top of glass and
seal.</p>


<h4>Mrs. Chandler’s Rhubarb Jam</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>3 lbs. (3½ qts.) of rhubarb in inch lengths</li>
  <li>1½ lb. (3 cups) sugar</li>
  <li>½ lb. of figs or raisins, chopped</li>
  <li>juice of 1 lemon</li>
  <li>1 cup water</li>
</ul>

<p>Let rhubarb and sugar stand together over night, add other
ingredients and cook slowly for about 3 hours.</p>


<h4>Rhubarb and Pineapple Jam</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>6 lbs. (7 qts.) rhubarb in inch lengths</li>
  <li>1 large pineapple, grated</li>
  <li>3 lbs. (3 pints) sugar</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook rhubarb and sugar ½&ndash;¾ of an hour, add pineapple, boil
up, put into jars, seal.</p>


<h4>Melrose Apple Butter</h4>

<p>7 lbs. pared, quartered and cored apples, 3 lbs. molasses sugar
if obtainable, if not, dark brown sugar. Put apples and sugar in
layers in a kettle, cover tight, let stand 12 hours or over night.
Then let come just to boiling and simmer without stirring, or
uncovering for 5&ndash;12 hours.</p>

<p>Apple juice made by boiling the skins of apples in ⅓ their bulk
of water, as for jelly, with lemon juice to taste, is a valuable addition.
Finely-ground coriander seed may be added. A little
date or prune marmalade may also be used.</p>

<p>A delightful butter may be made by combining plums and apples.</p>


<h4>Elder-berry and Apple Butter</h4>

<p>To each 2 qts. of elder-berry juice prepared as for jelly take 2
<a id="Page_68" class="pagenum" title="68"> </a>
lbs. brown sugar and ½ peck sour apples. Put juice and sugar
on to boil and add the apples pared, quartered and cored; simmer
slowly until thick. May be put into jelly glasses.</p>

<p>Equal quantities tomato and apple make a nice butter.</p>


<h4>Grape Marmalade</h4>

<p>Pulp the grapes and put the skins through the food cutter. Cook
the pulp and rub through the colander to remove the seeds.
Take ½&ndash;¾ as much sugar as there is of fruit, cook 20 m. The
skins improve the flavor.</p>


<h4>Lemon Peaches</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup lemon juice</li>
  <li>1 cup water</li>
  <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
  <li>peaches to fill 3 pint jars</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash and rub the peaches well, drop into boiling syrup of
lemon juice, sugar and water, cook until tender, put into jars
and seal.</p>


<h4>Ripe Cucumber Pickles</h4>

<p>Pare and seed cucumbers and cut into eighths if large. Soak
over night in lemon juice and water; in the morning drain, add
to hot syrup and boil until soft; skim out of syrup and put into
jars standing in hot water. Keep hot. Boil syrup 10&ndash;15 m.,
pour over fruit and seal; let stand three or four weeks before using.</p>

<div class="title"><i>Syrup</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>3 cups brown sugar</li>
  <li>3 cups lemon juice</li>
  <li>1 cup water</li>
  <li>½&ndash;1 tablespn. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Flavor with celery salt or seed, ground coriander or anise seed,
and raisins to taste. (Use anise seed sparingly). The cucumbers
may be steamed tender, put into jars and the reduced syrup
poured over.</p>

<p>Watermelon rind may be prepared the same.</p>


<h3>To Dry Blueberries</h3>

<div class="subtitle">
For buns, puddings and cakes.
</div>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. berries</li>
  <li>⅓&ndash;½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. water</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="Page_69" class="pagenum" title="69"> </a>
Mix, heat in preserving kettle until juice begins to exude.
Spread on buttered plates, dry carefully, stirring often.</p>

<p>I prize this recipe highly, as all will, I am sure, after trying it.
Cherries, peaches and pears are better with sugar sprinkled over
them before drying.</p>

<p>Dried fruits make a pleasant change from canned ones, besides
not requiring jars. Home-dried fruit far excels factory products.</p>




<h2 id="TO_CAN_VEGETABLES">TO CAN VEGETABLES</h2>


<p>While vegetables require a little more care than fruit in canning,
if they receive that care one will be rewarded with nice
fresh canned vegetables, free from harmful preservatives, all
through the winter.</p>

<p>In the first place, vegetables must be fresh, especially corn
and peas. Corn gathered early in the morning ought to be in
the cans and on the fire before noon, and peas the same day.</p>

<p>If one is alone with all the housework to do, it is better to put
up a few jars at a time.</p>

<p>Always use new rubbers on jars in canning vegetables.</p>

<p>“Blanching”, in this connection, means a short boiling in a
weak brine (¼ cup of salt to 3 qts. of water) and is used with
vegetables to eliminate the acids which they contain.</p>

<p>Place the vegetables in a wire basket or a cloth bag and dip
into the boiling brine, then into cold water.</p>

<p>Prepare nearly all vegetables as for the table, before blanching,
(okra and corn are exceptions).</p>

<p>After blanching, pack as close as possible in jars. Fill jars to
overflowing with water with or without salt, according to special
directions; fasten covers on tight (do not be afraid the jars will
burst), and set into a kettle or boiler with a board containing
holes or with several thicknesses of cloth or with thin tin rings
underneath. Surround jars ¾ their depth with water, cover
the vessel close so that the steam will be retained, bring to the
<a id="Page_70" class="pagenum" title="70"> </a>
boiling point and boil rapidly and continuously the required
length of time.</p>

<p>Use wrench for tightening covers of Mason jars during the
cooking. If Lightning jars do not seem to be air-tight, thin bits
of wood may be placed under the wires. With corn and peas,
it is better to have the water deep enough to cover the jars, for
boiling after tops are tightened.</p>

<p>Invert jars after removing from the water, cover to exclude
light, cool.</p>

<p>Store in dark, rather cool place.</p>

<p>Use cold water to surround jars at first if contents are cold
and warm water if contents are warm.</p>

<p>The length of time given is for cooking quart jars. ½&ndash;1 hour
less will be required for pints and 1 hour more for 2 quarts.</p>

<p><i>Asparagus</i>&mdash;Prepare asparagus as for the table; blanch tips
3 m., other parts 5 m., dip in cold water, pack in jars&mdash;the tips
in one, the middle of the stalks in a second, and the inferior
ends for soups, in a third.</p>

<p>Fill jars with cold water to which salt has been added in the
proportion of 1 teaspn. to the quart.</p>

<p>Fasten covers and cook according to general directions for
two hours, tighten covers and cook for one hour longer.</p>

<p><i>Asparagus in Full Lengths</i>&mdash;Place stalks in jars, heads up,
and pack as close as possible.</p>

<p><i>To Use</i>&mdash;Open jar, add ½ teaspn. salt, set jar in cold or lukewarm
water, heat to boiling, pour water off (save for soups), and
draw stalks out carefully on to slices of prepared toast.</p>

<p><i>Shelled Beans</i>&mdash;Follow directions for canning asparagus.</p>

<p><i>String Beans</i>&mdash;Prepare as for the table or leave whole, blanch
for 2 m., and follow directions for canning asparagus, using
water without salt to fill the jars.</p>

<p><i>Greens</i>&mdash;Narrow dock, milkweed, pigweed, purslane or spinach.
Wash the greens thoroughly, drop into boiling salted water and
<a id="Page_71" class="pagenum" title="71"> </a>
leave just long enough to wilt. Remove from water with skimmer,
pack into jars, cover with cold salted water and proceed as
with other vegetables.</p>

<p>There are no vegetables that we enjoy more in winter than
our “greens.”</p>

<p><i>Okra</i>&mdash;Wash young tender okra, cut off stems and tops, blanch
10 m., dip in cold water, cut in transverse slices or leave whole,
and finish the same as asparagus.</p>

<p><i>Peas</i>&mdash;Blanch fresh-gathered, mature, but not old peas, for 5
m. (old for 8 m.), dip in cold water, proceed as for canning asparagus,
using sugar, 1 teaspn. to quart of water if peas are not
sweet. Boil 3&ndash;4 hrs. in all; 1 hr. after tightening covers, with
water covering jars if possible.</p>

<p><i>Corn</i>&mdash;Prepare fresh-gathered corn as for drying. Pack at
once (filling all spaces) in clean jars to within an inch of the top,
cover to the depth of a half inch with slightly salted water, fasten
covers on as tight as possible, cook 3 or 4 hours, screw covers
down again, cover jars with boiling water and boil for 1 hour
longer. Remove boiler from fire and let jars cool in the water.</p>

<p>Ears of corn may be boiled in clear water 5 m. and dropped in
cold water before removing kernels.</p>

<p><i>Corn No.&nbsp;2</i>&mdash;Prepare as in preceding recipe and cook for
1 hr. after the water is boiling; tighten covers, invert and leave
until the next day. Cook for 1 hr. the second day and again
the third day, that is, 1 hr. each for three consecutive days.</p>

<p><i>Beets</i>&mdash;Boil small dark red beets for 30 m., drop into cold
water and rub the skins off. Place in jars, cover with cold water,
fasten covers, boil 1 hr., tighten covers and boil for 1 hr. longer.</p>

<p><i>Mushrooms</i>&mdash;Pour boiling salted water over mushrooms and
allow them to stand in a warm place until withered; cool, drain,
pack close in jars and cover with the water in which they were
standing; seal and cook 1½ hr. Tighten covers and cook ½ hr.
longer. Invert jars until cool.</p>




<h2 id="TO_DRY_VEGETABLES"><a id="Page_72" class="pagenum" title="72"> </a>
TO DRY VEGETABLES</h2>


<p><i>Corn</i>&mdash;Boil corn 2&ndash;5 m., score down the center of each row
of grains with a sharp knife. With a large sharp knife cut off the
thinnest possible layer from each two rows, then with a dull case-knife
scrape out the pulp from the hulls on the cob. Mix pulp
with that which was cut off, spread on plates or granite pans
and dry in a warm oven, stirring often. If the oven is too warm,
the corn will turn dark. Corn may be dried in the sun if it is
hot, but must be brought in before the dew begins to fall and
spread out in the house. It is better to dry a little at a time in
the oven and have it out of the way in a few hours. With proper
care it can be done in an afternoon.</p>

<p>When dry, put at once into dry clean jars and seal, or into
paper sacks tied tight so that no insects can get at it.</p>

<p>With care to keep it from souring, the corn may be dried without
cooking.</p>

<p>Any dried corn has a richer flavor than canned corn, but
words are inadequate to express how rich and fine flavored the
yellow sweet corn is when dried.</p>

<p>Corn for drying should be nice and tender; a little younger,
if anything, than for cooking green.</p>

<p>Directions for cooking dried corn are among the vegetables.</p>

<p><i>Shelled Beans</i>&mdash;Lima and all green beans may be dried after
shelling by being spread out in a dry, airy place and stirred occasionally,
and are quite different in flavor from dry, ripened
beans.</p>

<p><i>String Beans</i>&mdash;Cook beans until half done; drain, dry in sun,
pack in paper bags, keep in cool place. To cook&mdash;soak over
night, cook shorter time than usual.</p>

<p><i>Mushrooms</i>&mdash;String mushroom caps, also stems, on a cord
the same as apples, for drying, hang in sun and wind until just
before the dew begins to fall and finish drying over the stove, or,
dry entirely over the stove.</p>

<p><a id="Page_73" class="pagenum" title="73"> </a>
Put into dry, close covered jars or thick paper sacks. (May
wrap in waxed paper before putting into sacks). Keep in dry
place.</p>

<p>When first dried, mushrooms may be pulverized in a mortar
and the powder put into clean, dry jars. It is delightful for
flavoring soups and sauces.</p>


<h3>String Beans in Brine</h3>

<p>Put layer of salt 1 in. deep in bottom of stone jar or cask; then
a layer of nice, tender string beans 3 in. deep; continue layers
until cask is full. Cover beans with a board a little smaller
around than the inside of the cask or jar and put a heavy stone
on it so that the beans will be well covered with the brine. The
beans may be put in at different times, but must be covered with
the board from the first.</p>

<p><i>To Cook</i>&mdash;Soak over night in cold water, changing the water
several times in the early part of the evening. Cook the same
as fresh beans, changing the water once or twice while cooking.</p>

<p>They are as nice and fresh as when picked.</p>


<h3>Corn in Brine</h3>

<p>Put layers of fresh picked corn, cut from the cob, in crock the
same as string beans except that the layers of corn should be 1
to 2 in. deep only, and salt ½ in. deep. Have the top layer of
salt, and thicker than the others and keep the corn well under
the brine with a board and stone.</p>

<p>Soak over night for cooking, changing the water 2 or 3 times.
Cook in unsalted water.</p>




<h2 id="SOUPS"><a id="Page_74" class="pagenum" title="74"> </a>
SOUPS</h2>


<p>“The more liquid there is taken into the stomach with the
meals, the more difficult it is for the food to digest, for the liquid
must first be absorbed.”</p>

<p>Consequently, the most perfect hygiene in the use of soups,
would call for a few sips only, at the beginning of the meal,
which in some cases stimulates the flow of the digestive juices.</p>

<p>With a hearty dinner of other foods, a small portion of some
light soup or broth should be served, while a legume soup a chowder
or a purée may make the principal dish of the meal.</p>

<p>We seldom make a soup after a recipe. When we serve soups
every day, we purposely cook more than is required for other
dishes of such things as will make good ingredients for soups; or,
if used occasionally only, we make soup at a time when there
are left-overs that are suitable. We get better results from these
combinations, both from the variety of flavors, and because,
with few exceptions, reheating develops richer flavors in foods.</p>

<p>“Our Famous Soups” are some that we have made, at different
times, after this plan.</p>

<p>Under the head of soups are classed, bouillons or consommés,
bisques, purées and chowders; though some of them are not soups
in the strictest sense. For instance, a chowder is often made
of the consistency of a stew, with a small proportion of liquid,
and, as Francatelli says, “a purée is a kind of pulpy maceration
of legumes, vegetables, etc., which have been passed through a
fine colander,” but both of these are sometimes made with a
larger proportion of liquid and served as thick soups.</p>

<p>The word “bisque” means rich soup, so in using it we do not
say “tomato bisque soup” because the word soup is comprehended
in bisque.</p>

<p>Bouillons (<i>boo-yon´</i> or <i>bool-yon´</i>) or consommés are broths.</p>


<h3 id="SUGGESTIONS"><a id="Page_75" class="pagenum" title="75"> </a>
Suggestions</h3>

<p>Do not put everything through the colander, (celery and oyster
plant, never). Mastication in connection with soups is an aid
to their digestion as well as being more satisfying.</p>

<p>Use potatoes seldom in any but potato soups; potato water,
not at all. The addition of potatoes to an otherwise wholesome
soup might convert it into a fermentable combination: as well as
to remove it from the dietary of those who cannot use starchy
foods.</p>

<p>Cook turnips and carrots by themselves and drain before adding
to soups. The flavor of turnip in soup is often disagreeable.</p>

<p>Utilize the food cutter in preparing vegetables for soups.</p>

<p>As a rule, use oyster plant in slices, ¼ in. thick in the largest
part and a little thicker toward the end; but if desired fine, grind
it before cooking. In this way it retains its characteristic flavor.</p>

<p>Often the best way to thicken a soup is to heat the flour in
oil or butter (without browning) and add some of the hot soup
to it as for gravy, so avoiding a scorched taste.</p>

<p>Dried mushrooms washed well, soaked 2 to 4 hours, simmered
5 m., cut fine and added, with their juice, give a fine flavor
to many soups. Three or four small pieces are sufficient for
1½ to 2 qts. of soup.</p>

<p>Always keep a quantity of consommé or bouillon on hand, for
soups or sauces, or to pour over hash, or chopped potatoes, or
to moisten roasts.</p>

<p>Serve bouillon or consommé in cups with or without the
beaten white of egg in teaspoonfuls on each.</p>

<p>Whipped cream may be added to bouillon just before serving
or dropped by teaspoonfuls on the cups, with a leaf of parsley
laid on each.</p>

<p>When soups are lacking in character, the addition of water
and salt will develop a meaty flavor, relieving the “porridgy”
taste.</p>

<p><a id="Page_76" class="pagenum" title="76"> </a>
Raw nut butter may be added to any of the combinations of
vegetables in the proportion of 1 or 1½ tablespns. to each quart
of soup.</p>

<p>The water drained from boiled peanuts may be used in place
of raw nut butter, taking care not to use too much.</p>

<p>If you should have the thick nut stock, use not more than 2
tablespns. to each quart of soup.</p>

<p>Use herbs sparingly, some, such as mint and thyme, in minute
quantities.</p>

<p>In putting corn through a colander, first crush the kernels in
a pan or grind them through a food cutter, and put a very little
into the colander at a time.</p>

<p>Use poor or top parts of stalks of celery, crushed, for flavoring
soups.</p>

<p>Okra is a valuable addition to some soups, tomato soups especially.
When using it, take about ¼ less water for the soup,
and add from ¼&ndash;½ of a pint can to each pint of soup. Heat
carefully and serve at once.</p>

<p>The water from spinach is an invaluable addition to vegetable
soups, and with the addition of a little cream it alone makes a
delightful broth. The water from nearly all greens is desirable
in soups.</p>

<p>A little stewed asparagus adds very much to any vegetable
soup or chowder.</p>

<p>If soup has thickened by standing, add water or milk before
serving.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1½ tablespn. raw nut butter</li>
  <li>3&ndash;4 tablespns. chopped onion</li>
  <li>½ cup strained tomato</li>
  <li>2&ndash;3½ teaspns. browned flour</li>
  <li>1&ndash;1¼ teaspn. salt</li>

until the broth boils rapidly, then boil without stirring until it
looks dark and clear below the scum. Let stand off the fire
about 10 m., strain through 2 or 3 thicknesses of cheese cloth
laid over a colander; pour through wire strainer on to the cheese
cloth. Add more water if necessary after straining, to develop
a meaty flavor. Reheat, serve.</p>


<h4>★ Vegetable Consommé</h4>

<p>Omit browned flour and garlic in preceding recipe, substitute
celery salt for celery tops, and add a trifle of sage.</p>


<h4>White Stock</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>¼ cup raw nut butter or meal</li>
  <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
  <li>1½ level teaspn. celery salt or seed</li>
  <li>¼ level teaspn. powdered sage</li>

water to make 2½ pints, heat, serve.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_78" class="pagenum" title="78"> </a>
Dark Stock</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>¼ cup raw nut butter or meal</li>
  <li>1 medium bay leaf</li>
  <li>1 level teaspn. celery salt</li>
  <li>½ level teaspn. powdered sage</li>
  <li>¼ level teaspn. thyme</li>
  <li>1 level tablespn. salt</li>

  <li>2½ qts. water</li>
  <li>½ cup strained tomato</li>
</ul>

<p>Finish the same as white stock, leaving 2½ pts. of stock.</p>


<h4>Vegetable Stock</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>¼ cup each beans and split peas</li>
  <li>1 each medium onion and carrot, sliced</li>
  <li>1 stalk celery or ¼ cup celery tops or ¼ teaspn. celery seed or salt</li>
  <li>1&ndash;2 tablespns. chopped parsley</li>
  <li>⅛ level teaspn. thyme</li>
  <li>½ level teaspn. leaf sage or ¼ powdered</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Simmer all together 3&ndash;4 hours; strain, serve. Parsley may be
added after straining soup. Savory, marjoram and other herbs
may be used, or the herbs may be omitted altogether.</p>

<p>Other legumes may be substituted for the ones given. Tomato
or browned flour or both may be added. This stock is excellent
for gravies and sauces. A thick soup may be made by rubbing
the vegetables through the colander instead of straining
them out.</p>


<h4>★ Cereal Bouillon</h4>

<p>2½ pts. nice fresh bran pressed down. 2½ qts. boiling water.<!--TN: added period-->
Simmer together 2 hours or more; strain, add</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pint strained tomato</li>
  <li>1 bunch celery stalks, crushed</li>
  <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
  <li>¼ teaspn. powdered mint in a muslin bag</li>
</ul>

<p>Simmer together ½&ndash;1 hour, strain, salt to taste, heat, serve.
This should make 2½ qts. of soup. Other flavorings maybe used.</p>

<p>In using the bran put up in packages, sift it and use only the
coarse part.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_79" class="pagenum" title="79"> </a>
Tomato Broth</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. stewed tomato</li>
  <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
  <li>1 bay leaf</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>1 pt. water</li>
</ul>

<p>Simmer all together about 20 m., strain and add water for
1½ qt. of broth. Use plenty of salt. This broth may be cleared
the same as bouillon, leaving 1 qt. only. 3 or 4 teaspoons of
browned flour may be used.<!--TN: added period--></p>


<h4>Legume Broths</h4>

<p>Cook beans, lentils or whole green peas, until the water looks
rich, but not until the skins begin to break. Strain, making 1 pt.
of broth from each pint of legumes. (The legumes remaining
may be used for stews and soups). Add salt, heat and serve.
These broths are very satisfying. They may be varied by adding
different flavorings to legumes while cooking or to broths
after straining. Tomato, celery, onion with or without browned
flour, or thyme are suitable. Brown beans with onion have
quite a different flavor from white beans with onion.</p>


<h4>★ Nut French Soup</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 tablespns. raw nut butter</li>
  <li>2 cups stewed tomato</li>
  <li>6 cups water</li>
  <li>½ tablespn. browned flour</li>
  <li>½ large onion, sliced</li>
  <li>1 large bay leaf</li>
  <li>¼ teaspn. powdered sage</li>
  <li>¼ teaspn. thyme</li>
  <li>2½&ndash;3 teaspns. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Simmer ½&ndash;1 hour, strain, reheat, serve. An English woman
in sampling this soup after I had made it up, remarked that it
tasted like some of the French soups, hence its name.</p>


<h4>Egg Soup</h4>

<p>Add salt and butter to water, break eggs into a cup, one for
each cup of water, leave whole and turn slowly into the rapidly
boiling water, beating briskly with fork or wire whip until the
egg is in white and yellow shreds. Boil up well and serve with
crackers and celery. This is an emergency soup. Cream may
be added to the water instead of butter, or part milk may be used.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_80" class="pagenum" title="80"> </a>
★ Nut and Barley Soup</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>4 tablespns. raw nut butter</li>
  <li>2 qts. water</li>
  <li>2½ tablespns. coarse pearl barley</li>
  <li>½ bay leaf</li>
  <li>2 small sticks celery, or a few celery tops</li>
  <li>2½&ndash;3 teaspns. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook barley and nut butter in part of the water for 3&ndash;5 hours.
Add water to make 2 qts., with celery and bay leaf. Simmer
from 15&ndash;20 m., no longer. Remove celery and bay leaf, serve.
Bay leaf may be omitted.</p>


<h4>★ Cabbage and Tomato Soup</h4>

<p>Cook chopped or finely-shredded cabbage in boiling salted
water until tender; add stewed tomatoes, simmer 15&ndash;20 m., add
necessary salt and water, serve. Excellent.</p>


<h4>★ Celery and Tomato Soup</h4>

<p>Use stewed celery instead of cabbage in cabbage and tomato
soup. A delightful combination.</p>

  <li>⅛&ndash;¼ teaspn. sage</li>
  <li>2½ teaspns. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Blend nut butter and water. Heat to boiling, add rice, onion,<!--TN: added comma-->
sage and salt. Boil rapidly until rice is tender.</p>

<p>It may be necessary to add 1&ndash;2 cups of water after rice is
cooked.</p>


<h4>Onion Soup</h4>

<p>Simmer sliced onions in butter without browning; add water,
boiling, cook until onions are tender, thicken slightly with flour,
rub through colander, add salt and a little browned flour, more
water if necessary, and chopped parsley.</p>

<p>May cook raw nut butter with onion instead of using dairy
butter.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_81" class="pagenum" title="81"> </a>
Split Peas and Onion Soup</h4>

<p>Split peas, water, salt, raw nut butter and onion, a little tomato
sometimes. Cook all ingredients together until peas and
onion are tender. Strain or not as preferred.</p>


<h4>Potato Soup with Onion or Celery</h4>

<p>Simmer chopped onion in oil or butter, add boiling water,
potatoes cut in small pieces, and salt. Cook until potatoes are
tender, add water to make of the right consistency, salt, and
chopped parsley.</p>

<p>Serve with shelled nuts and croutons.</p>

<p>Finely-sliced celery may be cooked with the potatoes, and
onions omitted.</p>


<h4>Vegetable Soup No.&nbsp;1</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup each carrot, turnip and parsnip in small pieces</li>
  <li>2 cups each onion and celery</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. raw nut butter</li>
  <li>2 qts. boiling water</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>½ cup rice</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook all except rice for ½ hour, add rice and cook until it is
tender; add 1 tablespn. parsley, more salt and water if necessary.</p>


<h4>Vegetable Soup No.&nbsp;2</h4>

<p>Equal quantities carrot and turnip in small pieces, twice as
much onion and celery, with raw nut butter and water. Cook
until vegetables are tender; add salt and necessary water. In
their season, asparagus, peas, and string beans may be added.</p>


<h4>Vegetable Soup No.&nbsp;3</h4>

<p>Simmer sliced onions, celery or carrots and cabbage in water,
with raw nut butter, until tender. Add browned flour, salt and
necessary water; heat.</p>

<p>Mashed legumes may be used in place of nut butter in these
vegetable soups. Or they may be made into cream soups by
using milk instead of nut butter and water, with or without
thickening. Chopped parsley may be used in any of them.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_82" class="pagenum" title="82"> </a>
Tomato Soup</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 tablespn. oil or butter</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. flour</li>

  <li>1⅔ qt. water</li>
  <li>⅔ cup nutmese in small oblong pieces</li>
  <li>⅓ cup trumese in small oblong pieces</li>
  <li>⅔ pt. stewed or canned okra</li>
  <li>⅔ cup finely-sliced celery, stewed</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. rice, cooked</li>
  <li>½ tablespn. chopped parsley</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook raw nut butter in part of the water, add other ingredients,
heat well. Cooked noodles may be used instead of rice.</p>


<h4>★ Tampa Bay Soup</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 tablespn. oil</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. flour</li>
  <li>½ tablespn. browned flour</li>
  <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
  <li>1 cup stewed tomato</li>
  <li>3 tablespns. raw nut butter</li>
  <li>1&ndash;1¼ qt. water</li>
  <li>½ cup sliced okra</li>
  <li>½ cup sliced onion</li>
  <li>½ cup trumese in dice</li>
  <li>¼ cup nutmese in dice</li>
  <li>chopped parsley</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook tomato, raw nut butter, the 1¼ qt. of water, okra and
onion all together, rub through colander and add to sauce made
with oil, browned and white flour and the 1 cup of water. Add salt
and more water if necessary, and when boiling, the trumese and
nutmese, with chopped parsley. Throw egg balls into the soup
just before serving, or serve separately in each dish. Or, pass a
dish of boiled rice with the soup.</p>


<h4>★ Mother’s Soup</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. clean wheat bran pressed down in the measure</li>
  <li>3 qts. boiling water</li>
  <li>2 large onions, sliced or chopped</li>
  <li>¼ cup grated carrot</li>
  <li>1 bay leaf</li>
  <li>1&ndash;2 tablespns. browned flour</li>
  <li>½ cup chopped turnip</li>
  <li>⅛ teaspn. thyme</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="Page_83" class="pagenum" title="83"> </a>
Cook all except turnip and thyme together 1½&ndash;2 hours.
About 20 m. before removing from the fire add the turnip, and
in 10 m. the thyme; after another 10 m., strain, add salt and
more water if necessary, heat.</p>

<p>When soup is boiling rapidly, turn in slowly, in a slender stream,
batter for cream noodles, stirring constantly. Boil up well, remove
from fire, serve at once.</p>

<p>3&ndash;4 tablespns. raw nut butter may be used for stock instead of
bran, and 1½ teaspn. lemon juice added when soup is done.</p>


<h4>★ Bean Soup</h4>

<p>Put the beans into boiling water and cook rapidly until the
skins begin to break, then simmer until tender and well dried
out. The longer and more slowly the beans are cooked the
richer the soup will be. Rub beans through colander, keeping
them where they will remain hot during the process. Return
to the fire, add boiling water and salt, and simmer for an hour.
Stir well and serve.</p>

<p>There are three things essential to the perfection of bean soup:
1st., cook the beans without soaking or parboiling, 2nd., dry out
well after they become tender, 3rd., do not let the beans or soup
get cold at any time before serving. Warmed-over bean soup is
very good, but there is a certain meaty flavor lost by cooling
and reheating. Left-overs of bean soup, we usually combine
with other ingredients. Brown beans and red make very rich
soups, much better than black. One pint of beans will make
about 3 qts. of soup.</p>


<h4>★ Chick Peas Soup</h4>

<p>Make the same as bean soup (except that peas require longer
cooking), or cook in consommé. Very rich in flavor.</p>


<h4>★ Unstrained Bean Soup</h4>

<p>Cook nice tender white beans until partially cooked to pieces.
Add salt, and water to make of the right consistency, and simmer
slowly ½ hour or longer.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_84" class="pagenum" title="84"> </a>
★ Swiss Lentil Soup</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pint lentils</li>
  <li>1 large onion</li>
  <li>2&ndash;4 tablespns. browned flour</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook lentils and sliced onion together until lentils are tender
and well dried out, rub through colander, add the browned flour
and salt, with water to make of the right consistency. (There
should be from 2½&ndash;3 qts. of soup). Heat ½&ndash;1 hour. This
makes an unusually meaty-flavored soup.</p>

<p>The idea of combining onion and browned flour with lentils
was given me by one who had spent some years among the
French in Switzerland.<!--TN: was 'switzerland'--></p>

<p><b>Swiss Peas or Swiss Bean Soup</b>&mdash;May be made the same.</p>


<h4>★ Canadian Peas Soup</h4>

<p>Cook whole ripe peas with onion and a little garlic, rub
through colander, add salt, a little browned flour and powdered
sage, with water to make like a broth. Unusually good.</p>


<h4>★ Green Peas Soup</h4>

<p>Cook green peas until tender, put ¾ of them through the colander,
add water and salt, boil up, thicken with a little flour and
butter rubbed together, add the whole peas, heat to boiling and
serve.</p>


<h3 id="CREAM_AND_MILK_SOUPS">CREAM AND MILK SOUPS</h3>

<p>Cream soups do not necessarily contain cream, though the
addition of a little improves their flavor.</p>

<p>The simplest ones consist of milk thickened to the consistency
of very thin cream, salt, and a vegetable or some other ingredient.
If the vegetable is mashed, or is one that does not break to
pieces easily, the milk may be added to it, and the whole brought
to the boiling point and thickened. In a few exceptional cases
the ingredient may be cooked in the milk; nice tender green corn,
for instance.</p>

<p>A richer sauce is made by making a roux of 2 level tablespns.
of butter, and 1&ndash;1½ level tablespn. flour, with a pint of milk,
<a id="Page_85" class="pagenum" title="85"> </a>
put together in the regular way for sauces; but you will be surprised
to see how much better soups (with few exceptions) are
without thickening, being free from the porridgy taste of those
thickened a trifle too much.</p>

<p>A little cream with the water in which the vegetable was
cooked often gives a finer flavored soup than milk and is no more
expensive.</p>

<p>Sour cream makes a delightful as well as wholesome substitute
for sweet cream in corn, cabbage, tomato, in fact, nearly all
vegetable soups.</p>

<p><i>The following is a list of soups in which the general directions
are understood when no exceptions are noted. Salt is understood
in all.</i></p>

<p>★ <b>Cream of Asparagus</b>&mdash;Cook tougher parts and rub through
colander. Throw cooked tips in last unless desired for some
other dish. The very toughest parts only make a nice, delicate
flavored soup. This is one which favors cream and water instead
of milk.</p>

<p><b>Cream of Bean</b>&mdash;Lima, common white, or colored. Cook
as for water bean soup, rub through colander or leave in broken
pieces. Milk, or cream and water, no flour. 1 cup beans to
1½&ndash;2 qts. soup.</p>

<p><b>Cream of Bouillon</b>&mdash;¼&ndash;½ cup cream salted and whipped,
to each quart bouillon just before serving, either stirred in, or
laid on top of each cup in spoonfuls with a leaf of parsley.</p>

<p>★ <b>Cream of Cabbage, or Celery and Tomato</b>&mdash;Cabbage or celery,
and tomato soup, with a little heavy cream added.</p>

<p><b>Cream of Carrot</b>&mdash;1 cup of ground or grated carrot, cooked,
3 pts. milk and water, 1½&ndash;2 tablespns. butter, 1¼ tablespn.
flour; or, 1 cup strained tomato, ½&ndash;¾ cup cream, with water to
make 3 pts., and no butter.</p>

<p>Without the tomato, soup may be flavored with onion or celery,
and bay leaf, with chopped parsley.</p>

<p><a id="Page_86" class="pagenum" title="86"> </a>
<b>Cream of Celery</b>&mdash;1 pt. finely-sliced celery, stewed, milk and
cream added to make 3 pts., 1&ndash;1½ tablespn. flour with or
without 1 or 2 tablespns. of butter. Do not strain. When soup
is thickened, crushed stalks of celery may be steeped in it for
15 m., then removed.</p>

<p>★ <b>Cream of Celery No.&nbsp;2</b>&mdash;Steep leaves or poor stalks of celery
in milk for 15 m., add cream and flour, or flour and butter,
to make of the consistency of thin cream. Strain. May
add a little celery salt.</p>

<p><b>Cream of Chestnut</b>&mdash;Mashed boiled chestnuts, milk to thin,
cream, plain or whipped, or, milk and butter. May be flavored
with celery or onion or both.</p>

<p>★ <b>Cream of Corn</b>&mdash;1 pt. canned or grated corn to 3 pts.
rich milk, 1 level tablespn. only, of flour, a very little salt. Do
not let soup stand long before serving. A little onion improves
the flavor. If fresh corn is used, the milk may be heated in a
double boiler, the corn added and cooked 20&ndash;30 m., or it may
be boiled in a small quantity of water 6&ndash;10 m. The cobs may
be boiled in the water for 10 m. before and removed; or they
may stand in the milk while it is heating and be removed before
corn is added.</p>

<p>Fine fresh cracker meal gives a nice flavor to cream of
corn soup when used instead of flour for thickening.</p>

<p>A very little strained tomato imparts a delightful flavor and
makes a different soup.</p>

<p><b>Cream of Dried Corn</b>&mdash;Soak corn, grind, add to hot milk, or
cream and water. Heat in double boiler 1 hour, add salt, serve.
If necessary, thicken a trifle.</p>

<p><b>Cream of Dried Corn and Carrot</b>&mdash;Add cooked grated carrots
to corn and milk in above recipe and heat. Delicious.</p>

  <li>1&ndash;1½ tablespn. butter</li>

salt; heat, turn over whipped cream in soup tureen and send to
table at once.</p>

<p>Butter may be omitted, and the water thickened with flour.<!--TN: changed semicolon to period--></p>


<h4>Bisque of Cucumber</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 tablespns. raw nut butter</li>
  <li>1 pt. water, salted</li>
  <li>2 small onions, sliced</li>
  <li>4 large cucumbers, grated</li>
  <li>½&ndash;1 teaspn. celery salt</li>
  <li>1 pt. rich milk</li>
  <li>1 level tablespn. flour</li>
  <li>¼&ndash;½ cup cream</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="Page_93" class="pagenum" title="93"> </a>
Cook onion in nut milk (made by blending raw nut butter and
water) until tender, add the cucumbers and cook 5 m., add celery
salt and milk, thicken with flour; rub through colander, add salt,
milk or water to thin if necessary, and cream, whipped or plain.
Serve immediately.</p>


<h4>★ Milk and Tomato Bisque</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. chopped cabbage</li>
  <li>1 pt. milk</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. butter</li>
  <li>2 teaspns. flour</li>
  <li>1 qt. stewed tomatoes, strained</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. flour</li>
  <li>½ cup cream</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook cabbage 20&ndash;25 m., in just enough water to cook it tender.
Add milk, heat, strain. Heat butter and the 2 teaspns. of flour
and add cabbage flavored milk.</p>

<p>Thicken tomato with 1 tablespn. of flour and add thickened milk
just before serving. Add salt the last thing. Turn over whipped
cream in soup tureen or serve the cream by teaspoonfuls on each
plate of soup. Cream may be omitted.</p>

<p>Milk may be flavored with onion instead of cabbage, or not
flavored at all, but the cabbage gives an exceptionally fine flavor
to the combination. Equal quantities of milk and tomato may
be used, or twice as much milk as tomato, remembering to thicken
both milk and tomato (if all the flour is put into the milk it
makes it too thick to blend well with the tomato), to combine
just before serving, and to add the salt last.</p>


<h4>Milk and Tomato Bisque, with Eggs&mdash;Starchless</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1½ cup rich milk</li>
  <li>½ cup water</li>
  <li>½ tablespn. oil or melted butter</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>1 cup strained tomato</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook milk, water, oil and eggs the same as a boiled custard.
Remove from fire, add the hot tomato gradually, stirring, then
salt. Serve at once.</p>


<h4>★ Nut and Tomato Bisque</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>⅓ cup roasted nut butter</li>
  <li>1 cup rich strained tomato</li>
  <li>3 cups water</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="Page_94" class="pagenum" title="94"> </a>
Stir butter smooth with tomato, add boiling water, heat and
add plenty of salt. This soup requires no flavoring, but onion,
garlic, mint, caraway, or a delicate flavoring of thyme, are all
nice with it.</p>


<h4>★ Nut and Tomato Bisque No.&nbsp;2</h4>

<p>2 tablespns. raw nut butter cooked in water ½ to 1 hr., instead
of the roasted nut butter. Flavor with onion, garlic, or
delicately with thyme, if desired.</p>


<h4>Bisque of Spinach</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 qts. spinach</li>
  <li>3 pts. milk</li>
  <li>1&ndash;1½ tablespn. oil or melted butter</li>
  <li>1½ tablespn. flour</li>
  <li>1½ tablespn. chopped onion</li>
  <li>1&ndash;3 stalks celery</li>
  <li>¾ teaspn. celery salt</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat milk, onion and celery in double boiler for 20 m., strain,
pour liquid over oil and flour heated (without browning) in saucepan;
add salt and celery salt and turn on to spinach (which has
been cooked and chopped fine or rubbed through a colander)
gradually, stirring. Serve hot.</p>


<h3 id="CHOWDERS">CHOWDERS</h3>

<p>Many of the chowders are almost a “full meal” in themselves.
I can think of no luncheon more delightful than a nut chowder
with finger croutons, beaten biscuit or whole wheat wafers, with
fruit or other not too rich, dessert.</p>

<p>Raw nut butter may be used in all these chowders in place of
butter or oil, giving a meaty flavor.</p>

<p>A smaller proportion of liquid may be used when desired. The
vegetable strainings left from a consommé, rubbed through the
colander, make an excellent foundation for chowders.</p>


<h4>★ Seashore Chowder&mdash;Corn</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. to 1 qt. milk</li>
  <li>1 pt. water</li>
  <li>1 pt. corn grated or chopped</li>
  <li>2&ndash;3 tablespns. oil or melted butter</li>
  <li>5 small onions sliced</li>
  <li>1 qt. potato in small pieces (not slices)</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="Page_95" class="pagenum" title="95"> </a>
Heat oil (without browning) in kettle, add onions, simmer
10 m., then add the water, boiling, with salt and potatoes.
Cook until potatoes are just tender, not soft; add the milk, hot,
and then the corn. Heat to boiling and serve with crackers.
When fresh grated corn is used, of course it should be cooked in
a double boiler for 10&ndash;15 m. before adding to chowder.</p>

<p>The chowder may be thickened a trifle if the larger quantity
of milk is used, but the smaller is the usual quantity. Sometimes
only one-half as much potato as of corn is used.</p>

<p>Dried corn chopped after soaking makes an unusually fine
chowder.</p>

<p>Water and cream are better than milk.</p>

<p>A little browned flour is thought by some to be an improvement.</p>

<p>Fine chopped trumese gives the chowder a little more of
the seashore effect.</p>


<h4>Corn and Carrot Chowder&mdash;Unusually Fine</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1&ndash;1½ tablespn. oil or melted butter</li>
  <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
  <li>1 cup carrot in small, thin pieces</li>
  <li>1 pt. water</li>
  <li>¾&ndash;1 cup corn</li>
  <li>2½&ndash;3 cups rich milk</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat onion and carrot in oil, add water, cook tender, add hot
milk, and corn with salt. Heat.</p>

<p>½&ndash;¾ cup of tomato may be added for variety.</p>


<h4>★ Nut Chowder</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2&ndash;3 tablespns. raw nut butter</li>
  <li>1 medium onion, sliced fine</li>
  <li>½ cup carrot in small pieces (fancy shapes if convenient)</li>
  <li>½ cup finely-sliced celery</li>
  <li>1 cup stewed tomato</li>
  <li>1 cup nutmese, shredded or in dice</li>
  <li>½&ndash;1 cup trumese, shredded or in dice</li>
  <li>2 hard boiled eggs, shredded parsley, chopped or picked into small pieces</li>
  <li>½&ndash;1 cup cream</li>
  <li>water</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub nut butter smooth with water, add the tomato and more
water; cook ½ hour. Cook together carrots and onion and add
without draining to nut butter stock. Cook celery till perfectly
<a id="Page_96" class="pagenum" title="96"> </a>
tender and add with the water in which it was cooked; add salt,
nutmese and trumese, eggs, parsley and cream, with more water
if required. Let stand a few minutes and serve.</p>

<p>One cup of oyster plant with the water in which it was cooked
is a great improvement. ½ cup of turnip in dice, cooked by
itself and drained, and a few pieces of cooked red beet, in fancy
shapes, may be added just as the chowder goes to the table.</p>


<h4>Potato and Onion or Celery Chowder</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 tablespns. raw nut butter</li>
  <li>1 pt. potato in small pieces</li>

<p>Rub nut butter smooth with water, heat to boiling, add salt
and onions, cook 10 m., add potatoes and cook until tender.
Finish with water and cream, or water alone. 1 cup finely-sliced
celery may be cooked with the potato instead of the onion, and
chopped parsley added at the last.</p>

<p>Nut butter may be omitted and cream used.</p>


<h4>★ Tomato Cream Chowder</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2&ndash;3 tablespns. oil or butter</li>
  <li>2 large onions, sliced</li>
  <li>1 pt. stewed tomato</li>
  <li>1 pt. thin cream sauce</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Simmer onion, carefully, in oil until tender, add tomato, heat
and add cream sauce with necessary salt. Onion may be cooked
in a small quantity of salted water and oil omitted.</p>

<p>Add stewed celery for Celery and Tomato Chowder.</p>


<h4>★ Oyster Plant Chowder</h4>

<h3 id="PUREES">PURÉES</h3>

<p>The term “purée,” as used in this connection, means a <i>thick
soup</i> of ingredients rubbed through a fine colander. Thicker
purées of cooked nuts, fruits, legumes or vegetables are served
as true meat dishes, entrées, side dishes or relishes, according to
their nature.</p>


<h4>Almond Purée&mdash;small quantity</h4>

<div class="subtitle">
Very nourishing and digestible for invalids.
</div>

<p>Rub 2 tablespns. of almond butter smooth with 1&ndash;1⅓ cup of
water. Just boil up over the fire (or cook in double boiler till

<h4><a id="Page_98" class="pagenum" title="98"> </a>

<p>Cook peas, raw nut butter, bay leaf, celery tops and onion all
together in salted water, rub through colander, turn on to butter
and flour which have been heated together (or the butter and
flour may be rubbed together and stirred into the purée), add
necessary water, salt, sage and the teaspoon of fresh grated onion;
simmer for 5 m. Serve with strips of bread, or finger croutons.
The teaspoon of onion at the last is very important.</p>


<h4>Purée of Potatoes</h4>

<p>Boil potatoes cut in small pieces, sliced onion, stalks of celery
and a sprig of parsley in plenty of salted water till potatoes are
tender. Rub through colander, reheat, thicken just enough to
hold the ingredients together, turn over whipped cream in the
tureen and sprinkle with chopped parsley. Raw nut butter gives

<h3 id="FRUIT_SOUPS">FRUIT SOUPS</h3>

<p>Served with nuts, nut wafers or popped corn, are very refreshing
often, for luncheon or supper.</p>

<p>And when something must be served in the evening, those
not too tart, may be served with cocoanut crisps, pastry in fancy
shapes, cookies or sponge cakes and nuts.</p>

<p>Fruit soups are served hot, in cups, and cold or slightly frozen,
in glasses.</p>

<p>Sea moss, sago or tapioca (⅓ to ½ cup sago and ¼ to ⅓ cup
tapioca to each 3 pts. of soup) make the most suitable foundations
for them.</p>

<p>Honey instead of cane sugar may be used to sweeten.</p>

<p>The white of egg beaten, sweetened a trifle and flavored delicately
with rose, lemon or orange may be put on to each cup in
roses with a pastry tube or dropped on by teaspoonfuls.</p>

<p>Whipped cream may be used with some.</p>

<p>Berries, pieces of orange or slices of banana are sometimes
served in the soup.</p>

<p>Odds and ends of sauces can be utilized, and in the summer,
all sorts of fresh fruits.</p>

<p>Thin slices of Brazil nuts, crisp toasted almonds, English
walnuts, pecans or hickory nuts are suitable accompaniments.</p>


<h4>Strawberry and Pineapple Soup</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>⅓&ndash;½ cup of sago</li>
  <li>or</li>
  <li>¼&ndash;⅓ cup of tapioca</li>
  <li>2½ cups strawberry juice</li>
  <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
  <li>1½ cup pineapple juice</li>
  <li>sugar, if necessary</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="Page_101" class="pagenum" title="101"> </a>
Put sago or tapioca into the inner cup of a double boiler with
1 cup of warm water. Soak sago 1 hr., tapioca 10 m. to 2 hrs.,
according to the kind. When soaked, pour 1 cup of boiling
water over, add a little salt and cook until transparent. Add
strawberry, pineapple and lemon juice, and sugar to make delicately
sweet. Heat to just below the boiling point and serve at
once, or cool.</p>

<p>Small pieces of pineapple make a pleasant addition.</p>

<p>Cherry or currant juice may be used in place of the strawberry.</p>

<p>If too thick, a little water or juice may be added.</p>

<p>Other suitable fruit juices may be substituted for the ones
given: with those of strong and positive flavor a larger proportion
of water may be used. Of course, with some tart juices,
no lemon juice would be required.</p>


<h4>Cherry Soup</h4>

<p>¼ cup tapioca, 3 cups water, 1 pt. juice from dark red canned
or stewed cherries. Flavor with oil of lemon or orange rind if
desired.</p>

<p>May add some of the cherries just before serving.</p>


<h4>Sea Moss Fruit Soup</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 cups diluted red raspberry juice</li>
  <li>2 level teaspns. sea moss farine if soup is to be served cold, or 5 if warm</li>
  <li>⅓ cup orange juice</li>
  <li>3 or 4 teaspns. lemon juice</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. sugar flavored with the oil of the orange</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir moss into cold fruit juice, heat in double boiler 25&ndash;30 m.,
stirring often; add lemon and orange juice and sugar, stir till
sugar is dissolved. Serve warm or cold.</p>


<h4>Scandinavian Fruit Soup</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½ cup sago</li>
  <li>5 cups water</li>
  <li>1 cup cooked prunes in pieces</li>
  <li>½ cup stewed raisins</li>
  <li>½ cup tart fruit juice</li>
  <li>½&ndash;1 cup sugar</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak sago in 1 cup warm water, add the quart of water boiling.
<a id="Page_102" class="pagenum" title="102"> </a>
with salt, and cook until sago is transparent. Add other ingredients,
heat, serve.</p>

<p>Dried peaches, apricots or apples may be used sometimes.
Grape, currant or cranberry are suitable juices.</p>


<h4>Grape Juice Cream Soup</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. water</li>
  <li>1 cup Concord grape juice</li>
  <li>4 tablespns. raisins</li>
  <li>4 tablespns. currants</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. finely-sliced citron</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. sugar</li>
  <li>½ cup cream</li>
</ul>

<p>Stew raisins, currants and citron together, add other ingredients,
heat, serve.</p>

<p>Excellent without cream.</p>


<h4>Raisin and Almond Broth&mdash;small quantity</h4>

<p>Stew 1 tablespn. raisins cut fine, in 1 cup of water ½ to 1
hour. Add 2 teaspns. almond butter stirred smooth with 2
tablespns. of water, a trifle of salt and a little sugar if desired
or allowed.</p>


<h4>Blueberry and Cocoanut Soup</h4>

<p>Steep grated cocoanut in rich blueberry juice in a not too hot
place for 20 m. Strain. Add sugar as required and a little
lemon juice if necessary, with or without dairy cream. Serve
cold with sponge cake or cookies. Rich cocoanut milk may be
used instead of grated cocoanut.</p>


<h4>Tomato and Raisin Soup</h4>

<p>1 cup seeded raisins; stew till tender. Drain and add to the
liquid, water to make 1½ cup, 1½ cup strained tomato, salt, 4
tablespns. cream with 2 teaspns. sugar.</p>


<h3 id="SOUP_GARNISHES_AND_ACCOMPANIMENTS">SOUP GARNISHES AND ACCOMPANIMENTS</h3>


<h4>Croutons</h4>

<p>Of all the accompaniments to soups, croutons (crusts of bread)
are perhaps the most desirable as well as most practical. To make
them, cut slices of bread, not too fresh, into any desired shapes,
<a id="Page_103" class="pagenum" title="103"> </a>
dry, slowly at first, in a warm oven, then gradually increase the
heat until they are of a delicate cream color, for such soups as
bean, Swiss lentil or bouillon; but for cream soups, dry to crispness
without browning.</p>

<p>A favorite shape is made by cutting rather thin loaves of bread
into half inch slices, laying 3 or 4 together and cutting them
diagonally across the narrow way of the slice. This gives dainty
strips, convenient and attractive. The most common way is to
cut slices straight across each way, leaving the bread in dice.</p>


<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>

<p>Croutons, however, are not suitable for very delicate flavored
soups, such as cream of corn or cream of rice. For these, there
is nothing equal to dainty cream or nut-shortened sticks, or little
soup crackers.</p>

<p>Cook some of the small Italian pastes (you can be sure that
they are Italian only by buying them of the Italian dealer himself),
vermicelli, soprafini, ditalini, acini di pepe, or others, in
boiling salted water until tender (from 10 to 15 m.), drain and
add to suitable soups in the proportion of one ounce to ¾&ndash;1 qt.
of soup.</p>

<p>Add a few kernels of popped corn to each plateful of corn soup.</p>

<p>Roll lettuce leaves in tight rolls and cut off in slender rings; pick
up with the fingers and drop into hot soup; or cut lettuce with
vegetable cutter, round or in any not too fine shapes and scatter
into plates of soup as served.</p>

<p>Cut left-overs of pie crust into fancy shapes. Bake and drop
into each plate of soup in serving. They must not stand in the
soup long or they will dissolve.</p>


<h4>Dice Royale</h4>

<p>Coat ¾ in. dice of bread with beaten egg. Bake just before
serving. Serve a few in each dish of soup, or throw into tureen
just before sending to table. May roll cubes in finely-chopped
onion or parsley.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_104" class="pagenum" title="104"> </a>
Cream Soup Balls</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 large tablespn. oil</li>
  <li>½ cup pastry flour</li>
  <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
  <li>⅜ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>4 tablespns. finely-sliced celery, or</li>
  <li>¼ teaspn. celery salt</li>
  <li>2 teaspns. chopped parsley</li>
  <li>(parsley may be omitted)</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat oil in frying pan until hot, not brown. Add half the
flour and rub to a paste, then add boiling water gradually, stirring
until smooth.<!--TN: changed comma to period--> Stir in remainder of flour dry.</p>

<p>When the sauce is smooth and creamy and well cooked,
remove from the fire, cool a little, and stir in celery, parsley
and salt. The mixture will be very stiff.</p>

<p>Stand in cool place until perfectly cold, then shape into balls
1¼ to 1½ in. in diameter, or cones 1½ in. at the base, or cubes
of 1¼ in., or sticks 3½ to 4 in. in length by ¾ of an inch in
diameter. Roll in fine zwieback or cracker crumbs, then in
beaten egg (add salt and a tablespoon of water to each egg), then
in crumbs again.</p>

<p>Place on oiled tins a short distance apart, and set in cool place
till 15 m. before serving, then put into a quick oven and bake
until a delicate brown and cracked a little. Serve immediately.</p>

<p>If baked too long or too slowly, they will not keep their shape.</p>

<p>This makes 12 to 14 balls. ½ a beaten egg may be added
when the celery is, but the balls are more creamy without it.</p>

<p>The balls may be made the day before required, kept in the
ice box and baked at serving time.</p>

<p>Variation No. 1. Use 2 tablespns. of small pieces of hickory
or other nut meats instead of the celery.</p>

<p>Variation No. 2. Use 2 tablespns. of black walnut meal (made
by rubbing meats through a fine colander with a potato masher),
and a little onion.</p>

<p>Variation No. 3. Use ¼ to ⅜ teaspn. grated lemon rind, instead
of other flavorings.</p>

<p><a id="Page_105" class="pagenum" title="105"> </a>
Variation No. 4. Use chopped trumese, with sage and onion
in place of the celery.</p>

<p>The savory balls are used with the plainer soups, and vice
versa; or if both soups and balls are highly seasoned, use contrasting
flavors; for instance, the balls with lemon rind in Nut
French soup.</p>

<p>The egg balls should be used with care as they destroy the
flavor of many soups. They, poached eggs, and hard-boiled
yolks of eggs are especially suitable for some cream soups.</p>


<h4>★ Soup Balls&mdash;Choux batter</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup water</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. butter or oil</li>
  <li>1 cup pastry flour</li>
  <li>4 eggs</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat water and oil to boiling, stir flour in dry, stirring and
beating well with batter whip. When nearly cold, add eggs,
one at a time, mixing well, until all are in. Beat for 5 m., stand
in ice box for from 1 to 12 or more hours. Drop small quantities
from point of spoon into boiling soup, or bake or boil in tiny
balls, flattened.</p>

<p>Excellent baked, but unusually fine boiled, so delightfully free
from stickiness or doughiness.</p>


<h4>Egg Balls</h4>

<p>Rub 4 poached yolks of eggs to a paste. Beat with salt and
the white of 1 raw egg. Form into balls ¾ to 1 in. in diameter.
Roll in browned flour No.&nbsp;1, bake just before serving. May
beat white of egg first.</p>

<p>The raw yolk is sometimes used in place of the white. The
balls may be boiled for 5 m. in the soup, instead of being baked.</p>


<h4>★ Royal Paste</h4>

<p>Beat together 4 eggs, ½ cup thin cream, ½ teaspn. salt.
Pour into oiled tin, place in pan of water; bake slowly until firm.
Turn from molds at once.</p>

<p>When paste is to be cut into fancy shapes with vegetable cutters
<a id="Page_106" class="pagenum" title="106"> </a>
it should not be over ¼ in. deep in the pans; but if for dice,
it may be any depth.</p>

<p>This quantity is sufficient for 6 qts. of soup.</p>

<p>I often tint parts of paste with vegetable or fruit colors,
spinach green, parsley, carrots or cranberries.</p>

<p>The left-overs from cutting may be chopped for another soup
or a roast.</p>

<p>Use 1½ tablespn. of cream for 1 egg.</p>

<p>Royal may be flavored with onion juice. A little very fine
chopped parsley may be added to it before baking.</p>

<p>Consommé is sometimes used in place of cream.</p>

<p>4 yolks of eggs and 1 white may be used instead of 4 whole
eggs with the same quantity of liquid, and rich milk will do instead
of cream, but the paste will not be as tender.</p>


<h4>Spun Eggs</h4>

<p>Break eggs into cup (2 for each quart of soup). Leave whole
and turn slowly into rapidly boiling soup, beating briskly with
fork or wire batter whip, until egg is in white and yellow shreds.
Boil up well and serve soup at once. Or, beat eggs and let them
stand until the froth subsides, then add to the soup in the same
way.</p>


<h4>Thickening for Potato Soup</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 tablespn. flour</li>
  <li>½ cup cold water</li>
  <li>yolks 2 eggs</li>
</ul>

<p>Blend flour and water, add to boiling soup, boil up well.</p>

<p>Turn some of the hot soup slowly on to the beaten yolks, stirring,
add them to the soup, do not boil, serve at once.</p>

<p>Whipped cream may be added to potato soup just before serving.</p>


<h4>Rice Timbales</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>⅓ cup rice</li>
  <li>1 cup water</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. oil or melted butter</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak rice in water for half an hour, add salt and oil, stir well
and steam without stirring, ¾ to 1 hour. Press into small oiled
<a id="Page_107" class="pagenum" title="107"> </a>
molds. Set in a pan of hot water covered, for 10 m. Put one
in the center of each plate of soup, with or without a small leaf
of parsley on top. Rice may be boiled.</p>


<h4>Dumplings</h4>

<p>Cut bread or universal dough into small rounds or make into
very small balls; let rise and steam 20 m. or boil 10 to 15 m. in
rich soup just before serving, or boil in water and add to soup.</p>


<h4>Noodles</h4>

<p>I have had equally good success with all three of the following
combinations:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>4 eggs,</li>
  <li>salt,</li>
  <li>1¾&ndash;2 cups bread flour. (Always use bread flour.)</li>
</ul>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>3 eggs,</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. water,</li>
  <li>salt,</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. melted butter, </li>
  <li>about 2 cups flour.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>Yolks 4 eggs,</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. water,</li>
  <li>salt,</li>
  <li>about 1¼ cup flour.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat eggs a little with salt, add water if used, and flour for
stiff dough. Knead on floured board until dry but not flakey.</p>

<p>Then cut into three or four pieces and knead each piece, without
more flour, until very smooth. Roll each piece as thin and
as large as possible, some say to the thickness of a fifty cent
piece, hang on clothes bars, away from the fire, turning often
until dry but not brittle.</p>

<p>Roll up without flour and cut into fine slices from the end; or
fold in 1½ in. accordion pleats and cut fine, or cut into strips
of any desired width and cut these into narrow match-like pieces;
or cut into rounds or fancy shapes with vegetable cutters. If
cut in the first two ways, shake out upon a cloth or board and
dry ½ to 1 hour.</p>

<p>Add noodles to boiling consommé and boil rapidly, stirring
occasionally with a fork, for 10 to 20 m., or until tender.</p>

<p>Serve soup at once or noodles will become pasty.</p>

<p>Noodles may be cooked in boiling salted water, drained and
added to soup, or cooked for 5 m. in water and finished in soup,
giving a clearer consommé.</p>

<p><a id="Page_108" class="pagenum" title="108"> </a>
Noodles may be cooked in Mother’s and Nut French soup, as
well as in bouillon or consommé.</p>

<p>Noodles may be dried thoroughly and stored in jars or close-covered
box, almost indefinitely; but will require a much longer
cooking.</p>


<h4>★ Cream Noodles</h4>

<p>Beat 1 egg light, add 1 tablespn. milk and a pinch of salt;
then beat in 3&ndash;4½ tablespns. flour.</p>

<p>Turn slowly in a slender stream into rapidly boiling soup,
stirring constantly; boil up well and serve at once.</p>

<p>When the mixture is poured slowly from the point of a spoon,
it will be in shreds, and when cooked will be firm enough to
hold its shape, but not hard.</p>

<p>“Cooking is not drudgery&mdash;it is an art.... No one who stands

artistic services, he forgets that the stove is hot.”</p>

<h2 id="ENTREES"><a id="Page_109" class="pagenum" title="109"> </a>
ENTRÉES AND BREAKFAST, LUNCHEON AND
SUPPER DISHES</h2>


<p>“Entrées are the dishes served between any of the regular
courses,” one writer says. Another, “Entrées&mdash;a conventional
term for side dishes.” Entrées proper may or may not have a
large proportion of strength giving elements; but in this book
we are placing the foods richest in proteids under the head of
“true meats.”</p>

<p>As many entrées make good breakfast, luncheon and supper
dishes and <i>vice versa</i>, it seemed best to group these all together.</p>


<h3>CROQUETTES</h3>

<p>Egg for dipping croquettes should be slightly beaten with a
pinch of salt and 1 teaspn. to 1 tablespn. of water to each egg.</p>

<p>The whites of eggs alone (beaten just enough to mix with the
water), also yolks alone or crumbs without egg may be used.</p>

<p>Crumbs may be cracker, zwieback, dry bread or granella.
Corn meal, flour, or a mixture of crumbs and flour are used for
dipping. For vegetable and cereal croquettes, the nut meals
are excellent.</p>

<p>Mix fine chopped onion and parsley with egg or crumbs sometimes
for croquettes.</p>

<p>Full directions for shaping and baking are given with trumese
croquettes.</p>

<p>Suitable croquettes or patties may be served on beds of pilau,
or on plain boiled rice with gravy, or with macaroni in cream
sauce, and some are used as garnishes or accompaniments for
true meat dishes.</p>


<h4>Croquette Sauce</h4>

<div class="subtitle">To be used with different additions.</div>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1&ndash;2 tablespns. butter</li>
  <li>2&ndash;2½ tablespns. flour</li>
  <li>1 cup hot milk</li>
  <li>¾&ndash;1 teaspn. salt</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="Page_110" class="pagenum" title="110"> </a>
1 teaspn. grated onion may be used when suitable and also 1
egg, but croquettes are more creamy without the egg.</p>

<p>Rub the butter and flour together, add boiling milk, stirring;
boil, remove from fire, add whatever is to be used for croquettes,
cool thoroughly, shape into cones or rolls, set in cold place until
ready to use.</p>

<p>This quantity is sufficient for the equivalent of 2 cups of fine
chopped meat.</p>


<h4>Corn Croquettes</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. grated corn, (or 1 can of corn well drained)</li>
  <li>1 pt. stale bread crumbs</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. flour.<!--TN: as printed--></li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix, shape, bake. These croquettes may be breaded only.
They may be used as garnish for a timbale if shaped in cones or
balls, or served with cream sauce as a separate course.</p>


<h4>Celery Croquettes</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup mashed potato</li>
  <li>¾ cup finely-sliced celery</li>
  <li>1&ndash;1½ teaspn. butter</li>

  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not cook celery. Mix all ingredients while potato is hot.
Cool, shape, egg and crumb. Stand in cold place until ready
to bake.</p>


<h4>Rice Croquettes&mdash;cold boiled rice</h4>

<p>Add 2 or 3 tablespns. milk to 2 cups cold boiled rice. Heat
in double boiler until softened; then add 1 tablespn. butter, 1
beaten egg and salt. Cream may be used instead of milk and
butter. Cool, shape, roll in nut meal, bake. Serve as garnish
for a ragout, or with stewed green peas, cream or lentil gravy,
or maple syrup or jelly.</p>


<h4>Rice Croquettes No.&nbsp;2</h4>

<p>Cook 1 cup of rice in a quart of milk with a level teaspn. of salt,
in a double boiler until rice is tender and milk absorbed. Add
yolks of 4 eggs or 2 whole eggs, and 2&ndash;4 tablespns. sugar. Cool,
<a id="Page_111" class="pagenum" title="111"> </a>
shape, egg, crumb, bake. Serve with strawberry or fig sauce,
or with quince, elderberry, or some not too tart jelly. May
cook rice in half milk and half water, and if desired add a little
butter. Sugar may be omitted.</p>


<h4>Rice and Fig Croquettes</h4>

<p>Add 1 cup of fine cut or ground fresh figs to the preceding
recipe, with less or no sugar: 1 teaspn. of vanilla also if desired,
and serve with orange or cream sauce as dessert at luncheon.</p>


<h4>Bread Croquettes</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 tablespn. butter</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. flour</li>

</ul>

<p>Heat, do not brown, butter, add flour and stir smooth; pour
milk in hot, when smooth, remove from fire, add salt and egg
and enough bread crumbs to shape. Cool, shape into balls or
rolls, bake. Serve as a garnish or as a separate dish with or
without sauce. The mixture may be flavored with some of the
sweet herbs or minced onion.</p>


<h3>Oyster Plant Patties</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. cooked pulp of oyster plant</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. cream, with oyster liquor to make a large half-cup (or 1 tablespn. butter with milk and the liquor)</li>
  <li>2 eggs, or about ¼ cup cracker crumbs</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix all ingredients; sprinkle buttered shells or scallop dishes
with crumbs, put a spoonful of the mixture in each and sprinkle
tops of patties with crumbs. Bake in moderate oven on top
grate 5&ndash;10 m., serve at once.</p>

<p>Patties may be served as a second course at dinner, or for a
luncheon dish.</p>

<p>For <i>pulp</i>, grind about three bunches of oyster plant through
the medium cutter of a food chopper. Cook in a small amount
of water until just tender, adding salt about 5 m. before removing
from the fire.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_112" class="pagenum" title="112"> </a>
Asparagus en Croustade</h3>

<p>Cut the top crust from gems baked in flat oblong, or round
gem pans, and remove the soft inside part. Warm in oven.
Have ready one cup hot cooked asparagus tips.</p>

<div class="title"><i>Sauce</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>3 tablespns. butter</li>
  <li>5&ndash;6 tablespns. flour</li>
  <li>3 cups hot milk</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
</ul>

<p>Prepare the sauce as usual, adding beaten egg last, heat without
boiling, carefully stir in the asparagus tips, fill the crusts and
serve. A few tips may be reserved and pressed into the sauce
after crusts are filled, leaving the heads sticking up. Green peas
or stringless beans may be substituted for asparagus. Patty pan
pastry crusts may be used.</p>


<h3>Oyster Plant en Croustade</h3>

<p>Remove soft inside crumbs (they will go into a roast) from
gems. Fill with oyster plant in cream sauce, sprinkle with
crumbs and chopped parsley. Heat in oven, serve with celery
plain or fringed.</p>

<p>May use pastry crusts.</p>


<h3>Vegetable Cutlets</h3>

<p>Grate or grind carrots; cook, salt, drain. Cut young tender
string beans into small pieces and cook in salted water. Mix
with nicely seasoned mashed potato, add grated onion, a trifle
of crushed garlic if liked, chopped parsley, and salt if necessary;
shape into oblong cakes, egg, crumb or dip into corn meal
or flour. Pour a little melted butter over them in the pan and
brown in a quick oven. Serve with cream sauce, at once.</p>

<p>The mixture may be enclosed in pastry crust as surprise biscuit.</p>


<h3>★ Squash Cutlets</h3>

<p>Cook young, tender Fordhook or crook-neck squash in ½ in.
slices. Dip in egg and flour or crumbs. Bake, covered at first.
<a id="Page_113" class="pagenum" title="113"> </a>

porridge before molding.</p>

<p>Porridge may be molded in small egg cups and finished the
same as slices.</p>


<h3>Rice Cutlets</h3>

Armenian Scallop of Egg Plant</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 large egg plant</li>
  <li>1½&ndash;2 cups strained or unstrained tomato</li>
  <li>½ cup sliced or chopped onion</li>
  <li>3 or 4 cloves of garlic, fine</li>
  <li>chopped parsley</li>

  <li>2 tablespns. butter or oil</li>
  <li>a few bread crumbs</li>

<p>Slice potatoes very thin, put in layers into scallop dish,
sprinkling each layer lightly with flour or cracker crumbs and
salt until dish is ⅔ full. Nearly cover with milk, sprinkle with
crumbs, bake 1 hour or until potatoes are tender. Cover at
first and watch that milk does not boil over. A very little
chopped onion in the potatoes improves them. When flour is
used it is better to mix the milk and flour and pour over the
potatoes.</p>

sauce on top, sprinkle with crumbs, bake 20 m. Without the
onion they are called Cottage Potatoes.</p>


<h3>Scalloped Sweet Potatoes</h3>

onion.</p>


<h3>Scalloped Squash</h3>

<p>A squash that is not as good cooked in other ways may be used
for this dish. Pare and cut into small pieces, boil or steam
until just tender, not soft. Arrange in layers in oiled baking
dish with salt, a little sugar and if used, a little butter. Pour
over a very little milk or (if no butter is used) thin cream, not
more than ½&ndash;⅔ of a cup for a good sized dish. Bake covered
at first, then brown. Sprinkle with chopped parsley before
serving. A trifle of ground coriander or anise seed may be used,

recipe. Celery may be used (without simmering in oil) instead
of the onion. ⅓&ndash;½ cup of raw nut butter, instead of the oil,
rubbed smooth with water and boiled with it would give a meaty
flavor with the potatoes and onions. A mashed lentil crust,
when desired, adds to the nutritive value of the pie.</p>


<h3>Stuffed Winter Squash</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½&ndash;⅔ of a medium sized, nice shaped winter squash</li>
  <li>3 cups dry bread crumbs</li>
  <li>sliced onion</li>
  <li>garlic if desired</li>
  <li>chopped parsley</li>
</ul>

<div class="title"><i>Sauce</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>3 tablespns. oil or melted butter</li>
  <li>3&ndash;3½ tablespns. flour</li>
  <li>3 cups rich consommé<!--TN: was 'consomme'--></li>
</ul>

<p><a id="Page_127" class="pagenum" title="127"> </a>
Heat oil, add flour, then consommé, and salt if necessary. Saw
squash in two in the middle, or a little above the middle as required.
Scrape out the seeds and stringy pulp and rub with salt.
Let stand while preparing other ingredients; drain before stuffing.
Mix crumbs and flavorings, leaving out a little parsley:
pour part or all of the sauce over the crumb mixture. (The
quantity of the sauce will depend on the quality of the squash.
If it is a dry one it will probably take it all, and if it is quite a
large one, more of all the stuffing will be required). Fill the
squash, sprinkle with crumbs or corn meal, and chopped parsley.
Set into covered baker or cover with waxed paper and bake
until squash is tender which will be in 2&ndash;3 hrs. according to the
squash. Give it plenty of time. Serve on chop tray and send
plain onion sauce to be served with it.</p>

<p>Coarse chopped nuts may be put into the dressing and the top
of the squash garnished after baking with halves of nuts. This
makes a beautiful as well as palatable dish.</p>


<h3>Baked Squash with Celery Stuffing</h3>

<p>Make a thick sauce of rich milk and browned flour No.&nbsp;1.
Add to it chopped onion, minced garlic if liked, a few coarse
bread crumbs and a large quantity of fine sliced celery. Fill the
squash which has been prepared as in the preceding recipe,
sprinkle with crumbs, cover with slices of tomato from which
the seeds have been removed, or with pieces of canned tomato.
Finish with chopped parsley; bake covered until time to brown
over the top.</p>

<p>Nuts may be used with this also, and unbrowned flour in the
sauce if preferred.</p>

<p>A simple dressing of bread or cracker crumbs and milk with a
little cream or butter and chopped onion is nice in squash.</p>

<p>With such <i>summer squashes</i> as are of the right shape to bake,
the greater part of the inside may be scraped out, chopped and
put in with the dressing.</p>

Claudia’s Stuffed Egg Plant</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½ large egg plant</li>
  <li>⅓ cup boiled rice</li>
  <li>4 tablespns. tomato</li>
  <li>4 tablespns. grated onion (or 3 of chopped)</li>
  <li>⅔&ndash;1 tablespn. browned flour</li>
  <li>½ cup fine cut celery</li>
  <li>3&ndash;5 truffles cut fine</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. oil or melted butter</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>1 dozen chopped ripe olives may be used instead of truffles, or
3 or 4 soaked dried mushrooms chopped, or all may be omitted.</p>

<p>Boil whole egg plant in unsalted water 20 m. Cut in halves
lengthwise, or if only one piece is to be baked cut a little one
side of the middle, using the larger piece for stuffing. The
quantity of stuffing given is for one piece only. Scrape out the
pulp with a spoon, leaving a wall ½&ndash;¾ in. thick. Chop pulp
and mix with the other ingredients, using only half the oil or
butter. Rub a little salt over the inside of the egg plant, press
the stuffing in firmly, sprinkle with crumbs and chopped parsley
and pour oil over. Bake in quick oven about ½ hour, covered
when sufficiently browned.</p>


<h3>Stuffed Potatoes</h3>

<p>Cut slices off the sides of nicely baked potatoes (if large they
may be cut into halves, or they may be cut in two in the middle
crosswise, or a piece may be cut off from one end), scrape out
the inside, leaving a thin coating of the potato so that the skin
will not be broken. Prepare the same as mashed potato and
beat very light, refill the skins, brush with cream or sprinkle with
crumbs and chopped parsley, set in shallow tin and brown on
top grate in oven. To serve, arrange on a napkin on a platter,
with sprays of parsley.</p>


<h3>Meringued Stuffed Potatoes</h3>

<p>Add 1 or more yolks of eggs to the mashed potato, fill skins
and heat as in preceding recipe, then pile the salted, stiffly-beaten
whites of eggs on the tops and brown delicately.</p>


<h3>Stuffed Tomatoes</h3>

<p>Select large firm tomatoes, cut out the stem end, remove the
<a id="Page_129" class="pagenum" title="129"> </a>
inside with a teaspoon and turn upside down on a drainer for the
liquid to drain out.</p>

<p>Stuffed tomatoes may be served as a garnish for meat dishes
or on rounds of toast as a separate course, often the second
course. When suitable, they may be served on rounds or
squares of broiled trumese. Sometimes they are set into a rich
cream sauce on a platter, or in ramekins, and sprinkled with
chopped truffles. Chopped nuts and parsley may be substituted
for truffles. When desired, a half nut meat may be laid on top
of each tomato before sending to the table.</p>


<h3>Fillings for Stuffed Tomatoes</h3>

<p>Buttered crumbs, the tomato pulp and salt: to this may be
added grated onion or onion and sage. Cracker crumbs instead
of bread are sometimes used.</p>

<p>Crumbs, chopped nuts or trumese or nutmese, garlic, onion
and salt. Or, ripe olives and celery salt with chopped parsley
in place of onion and garlic.</p>

<p>Boiled rice, onion, browned flour, melted butter, tomato
pulp. Salt tomatoes well inside and sprinkle with chopped parsley
after stuffing.</p>

<p>Soaked dried mushrooms chopped, butter, crumbs, tomato
pulp, onion, salt.</p>

<p>Fresh mushrooms chopped, crumbs, cream or butter, salt.</p>

<p>Macaroni or spaghetti, tomato pulp, onion, butter, crumbs on
top.</p>

<p>Left-overs of macaroni may be chopped slightly for filling,
with small rings as top finish.</p>

<p>Always fill tomatoes to the top and finish with crumbs or
something suitable.</p>

<p>Bake 10&ndash;30 m. (according to the filling, and the ripeness of
the tomatoes) on oiled pans without water.</p>


<h3>Fruit and Nut Tomatoes</h3>

<p>Mix equal parts chopped nuts, currants and fine cut citron
<a id="Page_130" class="pagenum" title="130"> </a>
with two parts raisins cut fine and a little sugar. Fill hollowed
and drained tomatoes. Bake, serve plain or with cream or
whipped cream. Raisins and cocoanut with sugar, may be used,
or either one alone.</p>


<h3>Stuffed Green Tomatoes</h3>

<p>Mixture of onion, garlic, salt, sage, a trifle of thyme and the
chopped pulp of tomato in bottom of hollowed out tomatoes;
then each tomato partly filled with dice of nutmese, covered with
some of the mixture, and the top finished with a slice of ripe
tomato or pieces of canned tomato. Bake covered 1½ hour or
until tomatoes are tender. Serve on crisped large crackers with
Tomato Cream sauce or Chili sauce sprinkled with chopped
parsley. Use large tomatoes turned a little white.</p>


<h3>Peeled Tomatoes Baked</h3>

<p>Set whole peeled tomatoes in pudding dish, sprinkle generously
with salt, cover with buttered crumbs and bake: or, omit crumbs
and when tender, pour over them a thin cream sauce; sprinkle
with parsley and leave in oven 10&ndash;15 m.</p>


<h3>Rich Baked Sliced Tomatoes</h3>

<p>Cut tomatoes that are not too ripe into thick slices (halves if
thin), sprinkle with salt, chopped onion and garlic if liked, and
pour a little melted butter over. Bake. After laying slices of
tomato on to rounds of toast, add butter and flour to liquid in
pan, then a little cream; boil up and pour around tomatoes
on toast.</p>

<p>Oil and nut milk or cream may be used instead of butter and
dairy cream.</p>


<h3>Broiled or Baked Tomatoes</h3>

<p>Dip thick slices of not too ripe tomatoes in Mayonnaise or
Improved Mayonnaise dressing, then in fine sifted bread or
cracker crumbs. Brown in wire broiler or lay in agate pan and
bake in hot oven.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_131" class="pagenum" title="131"> </a>
Tomato Short Cake</h3>

<p>Cover layers of split hot short cake crust of universal dough
with Cream of Tomato sauce and serve. Or, prepare unstrained
tomatoes the same as for sauce and serve over the crust.</p>



<h3>Pilau&mdash;stewed rice</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup rice</li>
  <li>3&ndash;5 tablespns. oil or melted butter</li>
  <li>1 onion</li>
  <li>2&ndash;4 cups tomato</li>
  <li>3&ndash;5 cups water</li>
  <li>1½&ndash;2½ teaspns. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Simmer sliced onion in oil (without browning), add salt, boiling
water and rice. Cook until rice is about half done, then
add tomato hot, and finish cooking slowly without stirring. If
convenient, set into the oven after the tomato is added. When
the larger quantity of tomato is used, the smaller quantity only
of water will be required.</p>

<p>1½ cup sliced celery may be substituted for the onion.</p>

<p>Spanish rice calls for 2&ndash;3 cloves of garlic in addition to Pilau
with six cups of water and one only of tomato.</p>


<h3>Macaroni with Onion or Celery, and Tomato</h3>

<p>Substitute 1¼&ndash;1½ cup of macaroni for the rice in pilau.
Hominy also may be used in place of rice.</p>


<h3>Parsnip and Potato Stew</h3>

<p>Cut potatoes in quarters lengthwise, then across the center,
and cut parsnips into about the same size; cook separately or
together and drain; add both to cream sauce, heat, and serve on
toast, or put small slices of toast (zwieback) in the stew. This
is a delightful dish though simple.</p>


<h3>Succotash&mdash;Corn and Beans</h3>

<p>In the summer cook shelled Lima or other beans until tender.
Add corn which has been cut from the cob, boil 10&ndash;15 m., pour
in a little heavy cream, heat but do not boil; add more salt
if necessary. Succotash is one of the dishes which calls for
cream. Just a few spoonfuls is all that is required for a large
quantity of succotash, but that little perfects it.</p>

<p><a id="Page_132" class="pagenum" title="132"> </a>
Corn and beans may be cooked separately, combined and
seasoned. All sorts of corn and all sorts of beans may be combined
with great satisfaction, but the richest and most delightful
of all is nice dried corn (the yellow sweet corn is best) and
dry common white beans. Raw nut butter cooked to a cream
is good with the dry bean succotash.</p>


<h3>Dried and Hulled Corn</h3>

<p>A very near relative (which some prefer) to succotash is the
combination of dried and hulled corn; 2 parts dried and 1 part
hulled corn, finished with cream the same as succotash.</p>


<h3>Vegetable Hashes</h3>

<p>My first experience with a vegetable hash was at a hotel in
one of the new towns in North Dakota where the landlady herself
did the cooking. The hash was made from the different
vegetables left from a boiled dinner chopped and heated, and
was one of the happy gastronomic surprises.</p>

<p>Just such a surprise is in store for the vegetarian who utilizes
the remains of the trumese boiled dinner.</p>

<p>One rule with few exceptions to be followed in hashes, is not
to chop the ingredients too fine; they should be distinguishable
one from another.</p>

<p>Always finish hashes in the oven when possible, either in frying
pan or baking dish.</p>

<p>Cold baked potatoes or those boiled in jackets are preferable
for hash, but steamed or plain boiled ones will do if not too soft.
Rice may be substituted for potato. Do not be skeptical in
regard to these dishes; try them.</p>


<h4>Acushnet Hash</h4>

<p>Heat chopped onion in oil or butter, add 2 parts chopped
potatoes and ½&ndash;1 part coarse zwieback crumbs or granella, with
salt. Pour a little nut milk or dairy cream, and water over.
Cover and heat well, then brown in oven uncovered. A little
sage may be used sometimes, or both onion and sage may be
omitted.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_133" class="pagenum" title="133"> </a>
Cabbage and Potato Hash</h4>

<p>1 or 2 parts cold boiled or steamed cabbage and 2 parts
potato, with cream, or butter and water makes a very meaty
flavored combination. Do not brown this hash. Heat slowly,
covered.</p>

<p>Use parsnips or carrots in place of cabbage for other varieties.
Cream is used to advantage in these dishes. The recipes given
are merely suggestive of the many combinations possible.</p>


<h4>Hash with Poached Egg</h4>

<p>Nicely poached eggs, one for each serving, may be laid on to
any of the hashes spread on a platter.</p>


<h4>Savory Hash</h4>

<p>Equal quantities mashed or whole stewed lentils and rice or
chopped potato, with sage and onion, cream, or butter and
water, salt.</p>


<h3>Toasts</h3>

<p>We learn from Dr. Vaughn of the Michigan University, and
other eminent authorities, that yeast bread browned on the two
cut surfaces only, is as unwholesome as when fresh baked, the
slice being soggy and indigestible on the inside. So, for all
dishes where the ordinary toast is usually used, we recommend
the following:</p>


<h4>Zwieback</h4>

<p>Cut slices of light yeast bread into any desired shape or size.
(Square slices cut diagonally across are convenient and attractive).
Lay in a flat pan or wire dish drainer and put into a
warm oven. Dry well, then increase the heat of the oven
gradually and bake to a cream color all through. This process
partially digests the starch and renders the bread crisp, tender,
and nutty in flavor. Keep zwieback in a paper sack hanging
near the fire and it will not loose its crispness. Eaten dry with
porridge and other soft foods it furnishes material for mastication.
It is also a suitable and delightful accompaniment to fruits and
nuts, and may be used when toast points are called for as a
garnish. A recipe for special zwieback bread will be found
<a id="Page_134" class="pagenum" title="134"> </a>
among the yeast recipes. Salt rising bread makes especially
tender zwieback.</p>

<p>When moist toast is desired, dip the crust part of the slice
into the liquid first, then drop the whole slice in, taking it out
quickly with a skimmer so that it will not be mushy, and lay it
in a covered dish to steam for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Always salt the water for dipping.</p>

<p>When cream or milk are the liquids for dipping, do not have
them quite boiling as boiling milk toughens the toast. Do not
moisten toast when the dressing is thin enough to soften it.</p>

<p>Prepared toast and dressing may be sent to the table separate
and served on individual dishes.</p>

<p>With many, acid or sub-acid fruit dressings served over
moistened toast cause acidity in the stomach.</p>

<p>Never use milk for moistening toast for fruit dressings, always
water or cream.</p>

<p>When delicate fruits are to be used, strain off the juice, bring
it to the boiling point and thicken it a very little with cornstarch.
When perfectly boiling add the fruit, heat carefully and dip
over toast.</p>

<p>Many little left-overs of foods may be made into dainty and
satisfying dishes by being served on toast.</p>


<h4>Blueberry Toast</h4>

<p>The blueberry is one of the most suitable fruits for toasts.
The slightly sweetened stewed fruit may be thickened without
straining, as the berries do not break easily. Serve with Brazil
nuts or dried blanched almonds, or with chopped or ground nuts.</p>


<h4>Prune Toast</h4>

<p>Use sweet California prunes stewed without sugar, whole
stoned with juice, or in marmalade. Serve with halves of
English walnuts on or around slices when required.</p>


<h4>★ Sister Betty Saxby’s Toast</h4>

<p>Moisten white or graham zwieback according to directions
<a id="Page_135" class="pagenum" title="135"> </a>
and put in layers in a tureen with the following dressing. Cover
and let stand in a warm place 10&ndash;15 m. before serving.</p>

<p><i>Dressing</i>&mdash;To a pint of milk take about 1⅓ tablespn. graham
(not white) flour, or for skimmed milk, 1½ tablespn. flour, add
salt and cook in a double boiler 15 m. to ½ hour.</p>


<h4>Old-Fashioned Milk Toast</h4>

<p>Lay slices of zwieback in a deep dish with salt and bits of
butter. (Butter is not a necessity if the milk is rich). Pour hot
milk over and send to the table at once.</p>


<h4>Cream Toast</h4>

<p>Use hot thin cream without butter or salt in above recipe.</p>


<h4>Creamed Toast</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1&ndash;2 tablespns. butter</li>
  <li>1½ tablespn. flour</li>
  <li>1 pt. milk</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat butter, stir in flour, add milk hot, and when smooth a
trifle of salt. Dip slices of zwieback in sauce, lay in deep dish
and pour remaining sauce over. Set in a warm place for a few
minutes before serving.</p>


<h4>Cream of Corn Toast</h4>

<p>Thicken cream of corn soup a little more if necessary, or,
add corn to thin cream sauce, and serve on toast. Left-overs of
all sorts of cream soups may be utilized for toast: celery, asparagus,
string bean, oyster plant and spinach, also succotash and
other stewed or creamed vegetables.</p>


<h4>Lentil and Other Legume Toasts</h4>

<p>Use any lentil gravy or thickened lentil soup, cream of peas
or peas and tomato soup thickened, red kidney beans purée or
thickened soup, on moistened slices of zwieback.</p>


<h4>Toast Royal</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup drawn butter sauce</li>
  <li>3 eggs</li>
  <li>1 cup minced trumese or nutmese or ½ cup chopped nuts</li>
</ul>

<p>Add meat to hot sauce and pour all over beaten salted eggs;
<a id="Page_136" class="pagenum" title="136"> </a>
cook as scrambled eggs. Serve immediately on moistened
slices of zwieback, with baked tomatoes when convenient.</p>

<p><i>The following toasts</i> are of a different nature (though slices
of zwieback may be used instead of bread), but they are good
emergency dishes.</p>


<h4>French Toast</h4>

<p>Add ½ cup of milk with salt to 2 or 3 beaten eggs. Dip
slices of stale bread or moistened zwieback in the mixture and
brown delicately on both sides on moderately hot buttered griddle
or in quick oven, or in frying pan covered. Serve plain or
with any suitable sauce.</p>

<p>Drain slices after dipping in egg mixture; crumb, bake, and
serve with honey, maple syrup or jelly for Breaded French
Toast.</p>


<h4>German Toast</h4>

<p>Add grated or fine chopped onion to egg mixture and finish
the same as French toast.</p>


<h3>Spanish Cakes</h3>

<p>Batter&mdash;2 eggs, 2 tablespns. flour, 1 teaspn. of oil, milk for
smooth thin batter. Nut milk may be used and oil omitted.</p>

<p>Cut thin slices of bread into any desired shape (round with
biscuit cutter), spread each one of half the pieces with jelly, jam
or marmalade and press another on to it; dip in the batter, lay
on oiled baking pan, stand 15 m. or longer in a cold place. Bake
in a quick oven, serve with a bit of the preserve on top and
half of a nut pressed into each, or, dusted with powdered sugar.</p>


<h3>Mamie’s Surprise Biscuit</h3>

<p>Inclose small cakes of nicely seasoned mashed potato in pastry
crust; bake, serve with milk gravy, drawn butter or cream sauce,
or with celery only. This is the original recipe which leads to
the following variations:</p>

<p>Mix finely-sliced celery with the potato.</p>

<p><a id="Page_137" class="pagenum" title="137"> </a>
Use the mixture of black walnut and potato stuffing, or mashed
lentils or mashed peas for filling.</p>

<p>Serve peas biscuit with tomato or tomato cream sauce.</p>

<p>Serve lentil biscuit with cream, cream of tomato or mushroom
sauce.</p>

<p>Lentil biscuit with fresh mushroom or Boundary Castle sauce,
with or without celery, might constitute one course at a dinner.</p>

<p>Make a filling of minced trumese, salt, oil, chopped parsley,
onion and mushrooms into small cakes or balls, inclose them in
universal crust, and when light, steam 25&ndash;30 m. Serve with
drawn butter, flavored with onion and parsley, or as garnish for
a meat dish. Make balls quite small for garnish.</p>


<h3>Yorkshire Pudding</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½ cup flour</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>1⅓ cup milk</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. oil</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat eggs, add milk and pour gradually into flour mixed with
salt; add oil, beat well, turn into well oiled, or oiled and
crumbed gem pans; bake in moderate (slow at first) oven.</p>

<p>Serve as garnish or accompaniment to ragout, or if baked in
flat cakes, with slices of broiled or à la mode meats laid on them,
and gravy poured around. The pudding may be baked in a flat
pan and cut into any desired shape for serving. Whites and yolks
of eggs may be beaten separately. A large onion chopped may
be used in the pudding.</p>


<h3>Rice Border</h3>

<p>Pack hot boiled rice into well oiled border mold and let stand
in a warm place (over kettle of hot water) for 10 m. Turn on
to serving dish carefully.</p>

<p>Or, parboil 1 cup of rice in salted water 5 m.; drain and cook
in a double boiler with 2½&ndash;3 cups of milk and salt, until the
rice is tender and the milk absorbed, then pack into the mold.</p>

<p>1 tablespn. of butter and the yolks of 2 eggs may be added to
the rice about 2 m. before it is taken from the double boiler.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_138" class="pagenum" title="138"> </a>
Oyster Plant and Potato Omelet&mdash;without eggs</h3>

<p>With nicely seasoned, not too moist, mashed potato, mix
slices of cooked oyster plant which have been simmered in cream
or butter. Spread in well oiled frying or omelet pan. When
delicately browned on the bottom, fold, omelet fashion, turn on
to a hot platter, garnish. Serve plain or with cream sauce or
with thin drawn butter. Or, grind oyster plant, cook in a small
quantity of water, add cream or butter and mix with plain potato.
Finely-sliced raw celery or chopped raw onion and parsley may
be used in the potato sometimes.</p>


<h3>Baked Potatoes and Milk</h3>

<p>Wash potatoes well, scrubbing with vegetable brush. Cut
out any imperfect spots. Bake until just done. Break up,
skins and all, into nice rich milk and eat like bread and milk for
supper. A favorite dish of some of the early settlers in Michigan.</p>


<h3>Bread and Milk with Sweet Fruits</h3>

<p>Add nice ripe blueberries to bread and milk for supper, also
ripe black raspberries or baked sweet apples. They are all delicious.</p>


<h3>★ Apples in Oil</h3>

<p>Simmer finely-sliced onion in oil 5&ndash;10 m. without browning;
add salt and a little water, then apples which have been washed,
quartered, cored and sliced without paring. Sprinkle lightly
with salt. Cover and cook until apples are just tender, not
broken. Serve for breakfast or supper, or with a meat dish instead
of a vegetable, for luncheon or dinner.</p>

<p>The onion may be omitted. Use a little sugar when apples
are very sour.</p>


<h3>Onion Apples</h3>

<p>Simmer sliced onions in oil, with salt, in baking pan. Place apples,
pared and cored, on top of the onions; sprinkle with sugar
and put ¼ teaspn. in each cavity. Cover, bake; uncover and
brown. Serve for luncheon, or as garnish for meat dish.</p>




<h2 id="TRUE_MEATS"><a id="Page_139" class="pagenum" title="139"> </a>
TRUE MEATS</h2>


<p>“And God said, Behold I have given you every herb bearing
seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in
the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be
for <em>meat</em>.” Gen. 1:29.</p>

<p>“The food which God gave Adam in his sinless state is the
best for man’s use as he seeks to regain that sinless state.</p>

<p>“The intelligence displayed by many dumb animals approaches
so closely to human intelligence that it is a mystery.</p>

<p>“The animals see and hear and love and fear and suffer.</p>

<p>“They manifest sympathy and tenderness toward their companions
in suffering.</p>

<p>“They form attachments for man which are not broken without
great suffering to them.</p>

<p>“Think of the cruelty to animals that meat eating involves
and its effect on those who inflict and those who behold it.
How it destroys the tenderness with which we should regard
these creatures of God!”</p>

<p>The high price of flesh foods, the knowledge of the waste matter
in the blood of even healthy animals which remains in their
flesh after death, and the well authenticated reports of the increasing
prevalence of most loathsome diseases among them,
causes a growing desire among thinking people to take their food
at <em>first hand</em>, before it has become a part of the body of some
lower animal.</p>

<p>So, the great food question of the day is&mdash;“<i>What shall we
use in the place of meat?</i>”</p>

<p>Nuts, legumes (peas, beans, lentils and peanuts) and eggs contain
as do flesh meats, an excess of the proteid or muscle-building
<a id="Page_140" class="pagenum" title="140"> </a>
elements (nuts and legumes a much larger proportion than
flesh), so we may combine these with fruits, vegetables and some
of the cereals (rice, for instance) and have a perfect proportion
of food elements.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind, however, that <em>proteid foods must
be used sparingly</em>, since an <em>excess</em> of these foods causes <em>some of
the most serious diseases</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>bulk</em> of our foods should be made up of fruits and vegetables
and some of the less hearty cereals and breads.</p>


<h3 id="NUTS">NUTS</h3>

<p>As nuts occupy the highest round of the true meat ladder, we
give a variety of recipes for their use, following with legumes
and eggs in their order.</p>

<p>With nuts, as with other foods, the simplest way to use them
is the best. There are greater objections to foods than that
they are difficult of digestion, and in the case of nuts, that objection
is overcome by thorough mastication; in fact, they are
an aid to the cultivation of that important function in eating.</p>

<p>For those who are not able to chew their food, nuts may be
ground into butter.</p>

<p>Another aid to the digestion of nuts is the use with them of
an abundance of acid fruits. Fruits and nuts seem to be each
the complement of the other, the nuts as well, preventing the
unpleasant effects felt by some in the free use of fruits.</p>

<p>“No investigations have been found on record which demonstrate
any actual improvement in the digestibility of nuts due
to salt.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">M.&nbsp;E. Jaffa, M.&nbsp;S., Professor of Nutrition, University
of California.</i></p>

<p>Be sure that nuts are fresh. Rancid nuts are no better than
rancid butter. Shelled nuts do not keep as well as those in
the shell.</p>

<p><b>Almonds</b> stand at the head of the nut family. It is better to
buy them in the shell as shelled almonds are apt to have bitter
<a id="Page_141" class="pagenum" title="141"> </a>
ones among them. Almonds should not be partaken of largely
with the brown covering on, but are better to be blanched.</p>

<p><i>To Blanch Almonds</i>&mdash;Throw them into perfectly boiling water,
let them come to the boiling point again, drain, pour cold water
over them and slip the skins off with the thumb and finger.
Drop the meats on to a dry towel, and when they are all done,
roll them in the towel for a moment, then spread them on plates
or trays to dry. They must be dried slowly as they color easily,
and the sweet almond flavor is gone when a delicate color only,
is developed. For butter they must be very dry, really brittle.</p>

<p><b>Brazil Nuts</b>&mdash;castanas&mdash;cream nuts, do not require blanching,
as their covering does not seem to be objectionable. They are
rich in oil and are most valuable nuts. Slice and dry them for
grinding.</p>

<p><b>Filberts</b>&mdash;hazelnuts&mdash;cobnuts&mdash;Barcelonas, also may be eaten
without blanching, though they may be heated in the oven
(without browning) or put into boiling water and much of the
brown covering removed. They are at their best unground, as<!--TN: deleted double 'as'-->
they do not give an especially agreeable flavor to cooked
foods. They may be made into butter.</p>

<p>Brazil nuts and filberts often agree with those who cannot use
English walnuts and peanuts.</p>

<p><b>English Walnuts</b>&mdash;The covering of the English walnut is irritating
and would better be removed when practicable. This is
done by the hot water method, using a knife instead of the
thumb and finger. The unblanched nuts may however, be
used in moderation by nearly every one.</p>

<p>Butternuts and black walnuts blanch more easily than the
English walnut.</p>

<p>When whole halves of such nuts as hickory nuts, pecans or
English walnuts are required, throw the nuts into boiling water
for two or three minutes, or steam them for three or four minutes,
or wrap them in woolen cloths wrung out of boiling water.
<a id="Page_142" class="pagenum" title="142"> </a>
Crack, and remove meats at once. Do not leave nuts in water
long enough to soak the meats.</p>

<p><b>Pinenuts</b> come all ready blanched. When they require washing,
pour boiling water over them first, then cold water. Drain,
dry in towels, then on plates in warm oven.</p>

<p><b>Peanuts</b>&mdash;ground nuts, because of their large proportion of
oil, and similarity in other respects to nuts are classed with them,
though they are truly legumes.</p>

<p>The Spanish peanut contains more oil than the Virginia, but
the flavor of the Virginia is finer and its large size makes it easier
to prepare. The “Jumbos” are the cheapest.</p>

<p>To blanch Spanish peanuts the usual way, heat for some
time, without browning, in a slow oven, stirring often. When
cool rub between the hands or in a bag to remove the skins.
The best way to blow the hulls away after they are removed is
to turn the nuts from one pan to another in the wind.</p>

<p>Spanish peanuts can be obtained all ready blanched from the
nut food factories.</p>

<p>The Virginias, not being so rich in oil must always be blanched
the same as almonds. Be sure to let them boil well before
draining. I prefer to blanch the Spanish ones that way, too,
the results are so much more satisfactory.</p>

<p>When peanuts are partly dried, break them apart and remove
the germ, which is disagreeable and unwholesome: then finish
drying.</p>


<h4>A FEW SUGGESTIVE COMBINATIONS</h4>

<div class="subtitle">
For Using Nuts in the Simplest Ways
</div>

<ul class="list">
  <li>Brazil nuts, filberts or blanched almonds with:&mdash;</li>

  <li>Fresh apples, pears or peaches;</li>

  <li>Dried, steamed or stewed figs, raisins, dates, prunes, apple
  sauce, baked apples or baked quinces;</li>

  <li>Celery, lettuce, cabbage, tender inside leaves of spinach,
  grated raw carrot or turnip;</li>

  <li><a id="Page_143" class="pagenum" title="143"> </a>
  Breakfast cereals, parched or popped corn, well browned granella,
  crackers, gems, zwieback, Boston brown and other breads;</li>

  <li>Stewed green peas, string beans, asparagus, corn, greens, potatoes,
  squash, cauliflower, all vegetables;</li>

  <li>Pies, cakes and different desserts when used.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Nut Butter</h4>

<p>A good nut butter mill is an excellent thing to have, but butter
can be made with the food cutters found nowadays in almost
every home. If the machine has a nut butter attachment, so
much the better; otherwise the nuts will need to be ground repeatedly
until the desired fineness is reached.</p>

<p><i>For almond butter</i>, blanch and dry the almonds according to
directions, adjust the nut butter cutter, not too tight, put two
or three nuts into the mill at a time, and grind. When the almonds
are thoroughly dried they will work nicely if the mill is
not fed too fast.</p>

<p>Brazil nuts and filberts need to be very dry for butter.</p>

<p>Pine nuts are usually dry enough as they come to us.</p>

<p>All nuts grind better when first dried.</p>

<p><i>Raw peanut butter</i> is a valuable adjunct to cookery. To make,
grind blanched dried nuts; pack in tins or jars and keep in a dry
place.</p>

<p><i>For steamed butter</i>, put raw butter without water into a double
boiler or close covered tins and steam 3&ndash;5 hours. Use without
further cooking in recipes calling for raw nut butter.</p>

<p>Or, grind dried boiled nuts the same as raw nuts. For immediate
use, boiled nuts may be ground without drying.</p>

<p>When <i>roasted nut butter</i> is used, it should be in small quantities
only, for flavoring soups, sauces or desserts.</p>

<p>My experience is that the best way to roast nuts for butter is
to heat them, after they are blanched and dried, in a slow oven,
stirring often, until of a cream or delicate straw color. By this
method they are more evenly colored all through. Do not salt
<a id="Page_144" class="pagenum" title="144"> </a>
the butter, as salt spoils it for use with sweet dried fruits as a
confection, and many prefer it without salt on their bread.</p>

<p>The objection to roasted nuts is the same as for browning any
oil. Raising the oil of the nuts to a temperature high enough
to brown it, decomposes it and develops a poisonous acid.</p>

<p>Hardly too much can be said of the evil effects of the free use
of roasted nut butter.</p>

<p>“There are many persons who find that roasted peanuts eaten
in any quantity are indigestible in the sense of bringing on pain
and distress.... Sometimes this distress seems to be due to
eating peanuts which are roasted until they are very brown.”</p>

of Agriculture.</i></div>


<h4>Nut Meal</h4>

<p>Nut meal is made the same as nut butter except that the nuts
are ground fewer times through the finest cutter of the mill, or
once only through the nut butter cutter loosely adjusted. Either
cooked or raw peanuts may be used, but a cooked peanut meal is
very desirable. The nuts may be cooked, dried and ground, or
cooked without water, after grinding, the same as steamed nut
butter.</p>

<p>When one has no mill, meal of many kinds of nuts may be
made in the following manner:</p>

<p>Pound a few at a time in a small strong muslin bag; sift them
through a wire strainer and return the coarse pieces to the bag
again with the next portion. Be sure that not the smallest
particle of shell is left with the meats.</p>

<p>A dear friend of mine used to keep jars of different nut meals
prepared in this way on hand long before any manufactured ones
were on the market.</p>

<p>One writer says: “The children enjoy cracking the nuts and
picking out the meats, and it is a short task to prepare a cupful.”</p>

<p>Cooked nuts and some raw ones may be rubbed through the
colander for meal.</p>

<p><a id="Page_145" class="pagenum" title="145"> </a>
Nut meals are used for shortening pie crust, crackers and sticks;
and all except peanut, are delightful sprinkled over stewed fruits
or breakfast foods.</p>


<h4>Nut Butter for Bread</h4>

<p>Nut butters (except raw peanut) may be used on bread as they
are ground; but are usually stirred up with water to an agreeable
butter-like consistency, and salt added.</p>

<p>Strained tomato may be used instead of water for a change.
This is especially nice for sandwiches. With peanut butter
made from boiled or steamed nuts it has a flavor similar to cheese.</p>

<p>Nut butter is more attractive for the table when pressed through
a pastry tube in roses on to individual dishes. Use a cloth (not
rubber) pastry bag.</p>

<p>While pure nut butter, if kept in a dry place, will keep almost
indefinitely, it will sour as quickly as milk after water is added
to it.</p>


<h4>Nut Cream and Milk</h4>

<p>Add water to nut butter until of the desired consistency, for
cream; then still more, for milk.</p>

<p>Almond milk makes a delightful drink and can be used by
many who cannot take dairy milk. It may be heated and a trifle
of salt added.</p>


<h4>Cocoanut Milk</h4>

<p>If you have not a cocoanut scraper, grate fresh cocoanut, one
with milk in it, or grind it four or five times through the finest
cutter of a mill. Pour over it an equal bulk or twice its bulk, of
boiling water, according to the richness of the milk desired or
the quality of the cocoanut. Stir and mix well and strain through
cheese cloth or a wire strainer. Add a second quantity of hot
water and strain again, wringing or pressing very dry. Throw
the fibre away.</p>

<p>Use cocoanut milk or cream for vegetable or pudding sauces or
in almost any way that dairy milk and cream are used. Stir before
<a id="Page_146" class="pagenum" title="146"> </a>
using. To break the nut in halves, take it in the left hand
and strike it with a hammer in a straight line around the center.
It may be sawed in two if the cups are desired for use.</p>


<h4>Cocoanut Butter</h4>

<p>Place milk on ice for a few hours when the butter will rise to
the top and can be skimmed off.</p>


<h4>Ground or Grated Cocoanut</h4>

<p>Is delightful on breakfast cereals, or eaten with bread in place
of butter. The brown covering of the meat should first be
taken off.</p>


<h4>Shredded Cocoanut</h4>

<p>Put any left-overs of prepared cocoanut on a plate and set in
the sun or near the stove to dry. Keep<!--TN: was 'keep'--> in glass jars in a dry
place. This unsweetened cocoanut can be used for shortening
and in many places where sweet is not desirable.</p>


<h4>Milk and Rich Cream of Raw Peanuts</h4>

<p>May be prepared the same as cocoanut milk, except that cold
or lukewarm water is used instead of hot.</p>

<p>To raw nut meal (not butter) add one half more of water than
you have of meal. Mix and beat well, strain through a thin
cloth, squeeze as dry as possible. Let milk stand in a cool place
and a very rich cream will rise which may be used for shortening
pie crust, crackers and sticks, or in place of dairy cream in
other ways. The skimmed milk will be suitable for soups, stews
or gravies. It may be cooked before using if more convenient.
The pulp also may be used in soups. It should be thoroughly
cooked.</p>


<h4>Nut Relish</h4>

<p>Different nut butters and meals may be combined in varying
proportions. For instance, 2 parts Brazil nuts, 1 part each pine
nuts and almonds; or 1 part each Brazil nuts, almonds, pecans,
and pine nuts. Dry nuts well and grind all together or combine
<a id="Page_147" class="pagenum" title="147"> </a>
after grinding. Press into tumblers or small tins and stand in
cool place. Unmold to serve. The relish may be used in combinations
suggested for whole nuts, and it is a great improvement
over cheese, with apple pie.</p>


<h4>Toasted Almonds</h4>

<p>When blanched almonds are thoroughly dried, put them into
a slow oven and let them come gradually to a delicate cream
color, not brown. These may be served in place of salted
almonds.</p>

<p>Sweetmeats of fruits and nuts will be found among confections.</p>


<h3>COOKED NUT DISHES</h3>


<h4>Nut Croquettes</h4>

<p>1 cup chopped nuts (not too fine), hickory, pecan, pine or
butternuts, or a mixture of two with some almonds if desired; 2
cups boiled rice or hominy, 1½ tablespn. oil or melted butter,
salt, sage. Mix, shape into rolls about 1 in. in diameter and
2½ in. in length. Egg and crumb; bake in quick oven until
just heated through and delicately browned, 8 to 10 m. Serve
plain or with any desired sauce or vegetable.</p>


<h4>Nut Croquettes No.&nbsp;2</h4>

<p>1 cup chopped nuts, 1 cup cooked rice, any desired seasoning
or none, salt; mix.</p>

<div class="title"><i>Sauce</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 tablespns. oil</li>
  <li>½ cup flour</li>
  <li>1&ndash;1¼ cup milk</li>
  <li>1 egg or yolk only or no egg</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat but do not brown the oil, add half the flour, then the
milk, and when smooth, the salt and the remainder of the
flour, and combine with mixed nuts and rice. Cool, shape, egg,
crumb, bake. Crumb also before dipping in egg the same as
Trumese croquettes, if necessary. Bake only until beginning to
crack. Serve at once.</p>


<h4>Savory Nut Croquettes</h4>

<p>1 cup stale, quite dry, bread crumbs, ½ cup (scant) milk or
<a id="Page_148" class="pagenum" title="148"> </a>
consommé, ¼&ndash;½ level teaspn. powdered leaf sage or winter
savory, ½ cup black walnut or butternut meats, salt. Mix,
shape, egg, crumb, bake.</p>

<p>1 cup chopped mixed nuts may be used and celery salt or no
flavoring. Hickory nut meats alone, require no flavoring.</p>


<h4>Nut and Sweet Potato Cutlets</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup chopped nut meats</li>
  <li>2 cups chopped boiled sweet potato</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. butter</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix while warm. Pack in brick-shaped tin until cold. Unmold,
slice, egg, crumb or flour. Brown in quick oven or on
oiled griddle. Serve plain or with sauce <a href="#sauce_16">16</a> or <a href="#sauce_17">17</a>.</p>


<h4>★ Baked Pine Nuts</h4>

<p>After picking out the pieces of shell, pour boiling water over
2 lbs. of pine nuts in a fine colander. Rinse in cold water and
put into the bean pot, with 2 large onions sliced fine, 1&ndash;1⅓ cup
strained tomato and 2&ndash;2½ teaspns. salt. Heat quite rapidly at
first; boil gently for a half hour, then simmer slowly in the oven
10&ndash;12 hours or longer. Leave just juicy for serving.</p>


<h4>Black Walnut and Potato Mound</h4>

<p>Mix 1 qt. nicely seasoned, well beaten mashed potato, ½&ndash;1
cup chopped black walnut meats and 2 or 3 tablespns. grated
onion. Pile in rocky mound on baking pan or plate. Sprinkle
with crumbs or not. Bake in quick oven until delicately
browned. Garnish and serve with sauce <a href="#sauce_6">6</a> or <a href="#sauce_16">16</a>.</p>


<h4>Nut and Rice Roast or Timbale</h4>

<p>1&ndash;2 cups chopped nuts, one kind or mixed (no English walnuts
unless blanched), 2 cups boiled or steamed rice, 1½&ndash;3 tablespns.
oil or melted butter, salt.</p>

<p>Mix ingredients and put into well oiled timbale mold or individual
molds or brick shaped tin. Bake covered, in pan of
water ¾&ndash;1½ hr. according to size of mold. Uncover large
<a id="Page_149" class="pagenum" title="149"> </a>
mold a short time at the last. Let stand a few minutes after
removing from oven, unmold, and serve with creamed celery
or peas or with <a href="#sauce_16">sauce 16</a> (cocoanut cream if convenient) or <a href="#sauce_34">34</a>.</p>

<p>Loaf may be flavored, and served with any suitable sauce.</p>


<h4>Loaf of Nuts</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 tablespns. raw nut butter</li>
  <li>⅓ cup whole peanuts cooked almost tender</li>
  <li>½ cup each chopped or ground pecans, almonds and filberts (or butternuts,<!--TN: added comma--> hazelnuts, and hickory nuts)</li>
  <li>2 cups stale bread crumbs pressed firmly into the cup</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>¾&ndash;1 cup water or 1 of milk</li>
</ul>

<p>The quantity of liquid will depend upon the crumbs and other
conditions. Put into oiled mold or can, cover, steam 3 hours.
Or, have peanuts cooked tender, form into oval loaf, bake on
tin in oven, basting occasionally with butter and water or salted
water only. Serve with <a href="#sauce_9">sauce 9</a>, <a href="#sauce_10">10</a>, <a href="#sauce_57">57</a>, <a href="#sauce_59">59</a>, or <a href="#sauce_69">69</a>. Loaf may
be served cold in slices, or dipped in egg, and crumbed,
and baked as cutlets.</p>

<p>Other nuts may be substituted for peanuts.</p>

<p>One-half cup black walnuts and 1½ cup cooked peanuts,
chopped, make a good combination. A delicate flavoring of
sage, savory or onion is not out of place with these.</p>


<h4>To Boil Peanuts</h4>

<p>Put blanched, shelled peanuts into boiling water and boil continuously,
for from 3&ndash;5 hrs., or until tender. (When the altitude
is not great it takes Virginias 4 or 5 hours and Spanish
about 3 to cook tender).</p>

<p>Drain, saving the liquid for soup stock, and use when boiled
peanuts are called for.</p>


<h4>Nut Soup Stock</h4>

<p>Use the liquid, well diluted, poured off from boiled peanuts,
for soups. Large quantities may be boiled down to a jelly and
kept for a long time in a dry place. If paraffine is poured over
the jelly, it will keep still better. Use 1 tablespn. only of this
jelly for each quart of soup.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_150" class="pagenum" title="150"> </a>
Peanuts with Green Peas</h4>

<p>Boil 1 cup blanched peanuts 1&ndash;2 hrs., drain off the water and
save for soup. Put fresh water on to the peanuts, add salt and
finish cooking. Just before serving add 1 pt. of drained, canned
peas. Heat well. Add more salt if necessary, and serve. Or,
1 pt. of fresh green peas may be cooked with the nuts at the last.
Small new potatoes would be a suitable addition also.</p>


<h4>★ Peanuts Baked like Beans</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 lb. (¾ qt.) blanched peanuts</li>
  <li>¼ cup strained tomato</li>
  <li>½&ndash;1 tablespn. browned flour</li>
  <li>1¼&ndash;1½ teaspn. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix browned flour, tomato and salt, put into bean pot with
the nuts and a large quantity of boiling water. Boil rapidly ½
hr., then bake in a slow oven 8&ndash;14 hours. Add boiling water
without stirring, when necessary. When done the peanuts
should be slightly juicy.</p>

<p>Small dumplings steamed separately, may be served with
baked peanuts sometimes.</p>


<h4>Baked Peanuts&mdash;Lemon Apples</h4>

<p>Pile peanuts in center of platter or chop tray. Surround
with lemon apples, garnish with grape leaves and tendrils or
with foliage plant leaves.</p>


<h4>Peanuts with Noodles or Vermicelli</h4>

<p>Cook peanuts in bouillon with bay leaf and onions. Just before
serving, add cooked noodles or vermicelli.</p>


<h4>Nut Chinese Stew</h4>

<p>Use boiled peanuts instead of nutmese and raw nut butter,
and rice (not too much) in place of potato, in Nut Irish Stew.</p>


<h4>Peanut Gumbo</h4>

<p>Simmer sliced or chopped onion in butter; add 1 pt. stewed
okra; simmer 5&ndash;10 m. Add 1 pt. strained tomato, then ¾&ndash;1 qt.
of baked or boiled peanuts. Turn into a double boiler and add
½ cup boiled rice. Heat 15&ndash;20 m.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_151" class="pagenum" title="151"> </a>
Hot Pot of Peanuts</h4>

<p>Put layers of sliced onion, sliced potatoes and boiled peanuts
into baking dish with salt and a slight sprinkling of sage. Cover
the top with halved potatoes. Stir a little raw nut butter with
water and pour over all. Cover with a plate or close fitting
cover and bake 2 hours. Remove cover and brown.</p>


<h4>Peanut Hashes</h4>

<p>Cooked peanuts, chopped very little if any, may be used in
place of trumese with potatoes or rice for hash.</p>

<p>Bread, cracker or zwieback crumbs may be substituted for potato<!--TN: was 'pototo'-->
or rice.</p>


<h4>Peanut German Chowder</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. cooked peanuts</li>
  <li>1 large onion</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. chopped parsley</li>
  <li>½ medium sized bay leaf</li>
  <li>⅛ level teaspn. thyme</li>
  <li>1 small carrot</li>
  <li>1 level tablespn. browned flour</li>
  <li>2 level tablespns. white flour</li>
  <li>1 pint milk</li>
  <li>1 pt. thin nut milk or broth</li>
  <li>small biscuit of universal dough</li>
  <li>oil or melted butter</li>
</ul>

<p>Split biscuit and brown slowly in the oven. Slice or chop
carrots and onions and mix together; mix thyme, broken pieces
of bay leaf, both kinds of flour and salt, and pour into them
gradually, stirring, the milk and broth.</p>

<p>Put a little oil in the bottom of a baking dish, then layers of
the vegetables, peanuts and twice baked biscuit and pour some
of the liquid over. Repeat layers, leaving biscuit on top. Pour
remaining liquid over all. Sprinkle with what remains of the
chopped parsley. Cover and bake 1½&ndash;2 hrs. in a moderate
oven. Uncover and brown on top at last. Serve in the dish
in which it was baked.</p>

<p>With care, the chowder may be cooked in a kettle by using
more oil at the bottom, standing where the heat is not too intense,
and replenishing with water when necessary.</p>

<p>Serve on a platter or turn into a tureen with a cup of hot
rich milk or broth added if more liquid is desired.</p>

<p><a id="Page_152" class="pagenum" title="152"> </a>
The flavorings may be varied; savory and marjoram are sometimes
used, garlic for some tastes, also a little tomato. The
herbs may be omitted entirely. Crackers may take the place of
biscuit. Nut milk only, may be used.</p>


<h4>Peanut and Rice Croquettes</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 cups boiled or baked peanuts</li>
  <li>2 cups boiled rice</li>
  <li>1½ tablespn. oil</li>
  <li>sage, savoury or chopped onion</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop nuts very little if at all. Mix all ingredients. Shape,
egg, crumb, bake. Serve plain or with <a href="#sauce_6">sauce 6</a>, <a href="#sauce_44">44</a>, <a href="#sauce_57">57</a>, or <a href="#sauce_75">75</a><!--TN: was '72'; changed per errata list-->.</p>


<h4>Peanut Pie</h4>

<p>Universal crust of ¾&ndash;1 cup of liquid, 1 qt. of peanuts boiled with
salt and a little lemon juice, drained (liquid saved for soups and
gravies). Chopped onion and parsley.</p>

<div class="title"><i>Sauce</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>5 tablespns. oil and melted butter or all butter</li>
  <li>6 tablespns. flour</li>
  <li>1 qt. boiling water</li>
  <li>salt</li>

<p>Mix butter and flour, pouring boiling water over, boil up, add
salt, and half of onion and parsley; pour into oiled baking dish,
put peanuts in, sprinkle remainder of onion and parsley over,
cool to lukewarm, lay crust on, let rise, bake.</p>

<p>A pastry, rice or mashed potato crust (without eggs) may be
used: if pastry, put a cup in the center of the pie to support
the crust; with potato crust it would be better to simmer the
onion in the oil of the sauce first.</p>


<h4>Peanut Pie with Turnip Crust</h4>

<p>Bake or boil peanuts (leaving quite dry when done) with
sliced onion and a little carrot, browned flour and a little tomato,
parsley, salt and celery salt, a trifle of thyme and garlic if desired.
Thicken slightly, turn into baking dish, cover with mashed turnip,
sprinkle with crumbs and chopped parsley, dot with butter
or oil. Bake until top is nicely browned.</p>

<h3 id="TRUMESE">TRUMESE</h3>

<p>Many years ago when experimenting with gluten washed from
wheat, the thought came to me that it would be a good thing if
it could be combined with nuts, as the nuts would supply the oil
lacking in the gluten. From former experiments I knew it would
be a difficult problem, but it was finally solved and has resulted
in giving to the world a valuable food product, which gives me
great joy.</p>

<p>I give directions (the results of my own experimenting) for
making this food as perfectly as it can be made in our homes
without the aid of special machinery.</p>

<p>Whether it pays to make it or not depends on the value of
our time or whether we can procure similar foods all ready prepared.
(Similar manufactured foods on the market are called
“protose,” “nutfoda” and “nut cero”, according to where they
are made).</p>

<p>A part of the process will be entirely new to many but it is
not at all difficult, and if directions are carefully followed the
result will be success and soon the making of a quantity of “trumese,”
as I have called it for convenience, will not be considered
a greater task than baking a batch of bread.</p>

<p><a id="Page_155" class="pagenum" title="155"> </a>
The first thing of importance in making trumese is securing a
good <i>fresh bread flour</i> one that is called a heavy flour, not
a blended or a light flour.</p>

<p>A good bread flour will yield about two pounds of gluten to
each seven pounds of flour: but in trying a brand with which
you are not familiar, take ½&ndash;1 lb. more if you wish to have two
pounds of gluten.</p>

<p>I give the recipe for two pounds of gluten, but if you are
making trumese for the first time it may be well to take half
that quantity.</p>

<p>The following suggestions will enable you to substitute measures
for weights if you have no scales, and to calculate the recipe
for trumese:</p>

<p>1 scant qt. of bread flour, laid lightly in the measure, equals 1 lb.</p>

<p>1 scant qt. of washed gluten equals 2 lbs.</p>

<p>1 scant pt. of blanched, dried, Virginia peanuts, before grinding,
equals ½ lb.</p>

<p>1 scant half pt. of Virginia butter equals ½ lb.</p>

<p>1 good ¾ pt. blanched, dried, Spanish peanuts, before grinding,
equals ½ lb.</p>

<p>1 good ⅜ pt. of Spanish butter equals ½ lb.</p>

<p>1 large ¾ qt. of pine nuts equals 1 lb.</p>

<p>Spanish peanuts require 3 hours for cooking.</p>

<p>Virginia peanuts require 4&ndash;5 hours for cooking.</p>

<p>In mixing flour and water, calculate a little over 1 cup of water
to each pound of flour, or 8½&ndash;9 cups for 7 lbs.</p>

<p>The starch from the first one or two washings of the gluten
dough may be used wherever thickening is required; and for
blanc mange, by adding it to boiling (sweetened or unsweetened)
milk until of the right consistency to mold; or, for starching
clothes. It is much better than whole flour for any of these
purposes. It may also be used in place of the corn starch in
<a id="Page_156" class="pagenum" title="156"> </a>
Corn Starch Nutmese. No exact rule can be given for that,
but a trial or two will enable one to calculate the quantity, and<!--TN: deleted double 'and'-->
the nutmese is superior to that made with corn starch.</p>

<p>Make consommés double strength when using them for liquid
in trumese. As a rule, it is better to make trumese plain and
season as desired when preparing for the table.</p>

<p>If cans containing trumese do not leak, cook in a kettle of
water with something beneath the cans, otherwise use a steamer.
If <i>glass</i> jars are used, start in <em>cold water</em> and afterwards put into
steamer, if preferring not to leave in kettle.</p>

<p>Trumese from peanuts is more satisfactory in flavor as well as
cheaper, but to meet all cases I give recipes for making it of
different kinds of nuts. The general directions will apply to all.</p>


<h4>Trumese</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 lbs. gluten</li>
  <li>½ lb. raw Virginia peanut butter</li>
  <li>½ lb. Virginia peanuts cooked 4 hrs.</li>
  <li>3½ teaspns. salt</li>
  <li>2&ndash;2½ cups very strong cereal coffee</li>
</ul>

<p>If not sure of a pure cereal coffee use 4 teaspns. browned flour
with 2 cups of water.</p>

<p>Steam 6&ndash;12 hrs., or steam 5 hrs. and bake 1 hr. in a very slow
oven.</p>

<p>The cooked peanuts are boiled and drained and the liquid
saved for soups.</p>


<h4>TO PREPARE THE GLUTEN</h4>

<p>When sifted flour is weighed or measured, spread about ⅓ of
it on the molding board and put the remainder in a pan. To
this add cold water, stirring, until you think the dough when
kneaded with the flour on the board will be very stiff. Stir the
soft dough well, turn it on to the board and knead in the remaining
flour. If dough is too soft it will waste in washing, and if
too stiff (of which there is not much danger) it will be more
difficult to wash.</p>

<p><a id="Page_157" class="pagenum" title="157"> </a>
After kneading return the dough to the pan, cover with cold
water (or with several thicknesses of towel wrung out of cold
water) and let it stand ½ hr. only.</p>

<p>Now, set the pan in the sink with a large fine colander in the
dish drainer beside it. Let water run from the faucet to nearly
fill the pan (if the water from the faucet is very cold, have a
teakettle of hot water at your right hand to take off the chill)
and work the dough with the hands until the water is thick with
starch. Pour that through a strainer into some vessel where it
can settle, to be used for any of the purposes mentioned. Continue
to wash the dough, draining the water through the colander
(so as to catch any particles of gluten) into the sink, until no
starch remains in the water. You now have the part of the
wheat which gives strength, the proteid element. Put the mass
of gluten into a bowl, cover and let stand in a cold place about
an hour (no longer,) draining occasionally.</p>

<p>Weigh out the 2 lbs. of gluten, run it through the food cutter
with the finest knife, add the cooked and raw nuts which have
been ground into butter and mixed together with the salt, and
put all through the machine five or six times. If desired very
fine, use the nut butter cutter the last time. Now mix with the
cereal coffee, put into oiled cans with close fitting covers and
steam. Sealed glass jars may be used if it is necessary to keep
the trumese for some time, but it cannot be taken out of them
in as good shape.</p>

<p><i>Another</i> way to fill the cans is to divide the nut and gluten
mixture into equal parts, put equal parts of the liquid into as
many different cans, and run each part of the mixture through
the mill again into the separate cans, or drop it into the cans in
the shreds in which it comes from the mill. This may give a
little better fibre.</p>

<p><i>Another</i> way of preparing the whole. Cut the gluten into
pieces with the shears; mix the cooked and uncooked nuts without
grinding; put a piece of gluten into the mill, then a few nuts,
<a id="Page_158" class="pagenum" title="158"> </a>
grinding, until all are through. Sprinkle salt over the mass and
put it through the mill five or six times more, the last time with
the nut butter cutter. This gives a coarser grained trumese,
but is an easier way.</p>

<p>A still easier way is to use all cooked nuts, but the trumese is
a little tasteless to eat as it comes from the can. In making it,
use 4½ teaspns. of salt and 2 cups of liquid only.</p>


<h4>Trumese No.&nbsp;2</h4>

<div class="subtitle">Larger proportion of nuts</div>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 lb. gluten</li>
  <li>¼ lb. raw nuts or butter</li>
  <li>¾ lb. cooked nuts or butter</li>
  <li>3 teaspns. salt</li>
  <li>about 1¼ cup cereal coffee</li>
</ul>

<p>Steam 6&ndash;12 hrs., or steam 5 hrs. and bake 1 hr. When baked
1 hr., use about 1½ cup cereal coffee.</p>


<h4>Red Kidney Bean Trumese</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 lb. gluten</li>
  <li>½ lb. raw nut butter</li>
  <li>½ lb. (1⅓ cup) red kidney beans</li>
  <li>3½&ndash;4 teaspns. salt</li>
  <li>7 tablespns. (large half cup) cereal coffee</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook beans until tender and dry, rub through colander, combine

<h3 id="TRUMESE_DISHES">TRUMESE DISHES</h3>

<p>Trumese may be cut down the center, if loaf is round, laid on
its flat surface, sliced and served with celery, olives, apples, salt
and oil, oil and lemon juice;<!--TN: as printed--> Chili, chutney, apple or gooseberry
sauce or jelly.</p>

<p>When serving trumese to any one for the first time, prepare
it in some of the hot ways, either broiled with a nice sauce, or
in cutlets or pie perhaps, since many people would not be favorably
impressed with it cold, until their taste had been educated
to it.</p>

<p>“Taste is a matter of education.” We naturally like what
we have been accustomed to.</p>


<h4>Trumese Salad Entrée. Better than Sardines</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 tablespn. chopped parsley</li>
  <li>¾ tablespn. chopped onion</li>
  <li>¾&ndash;1 teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>¾&ndash;1 teaspn. celery salt</li>
  <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
  <li>⅓ cup lemon juice</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix dry ingredients, add oil, then lemon juice slowly, stirring.
Pour this over 1 lb. of trumese which has been cut in suitable
shapes and laid in a flat pan. Let stand 2 hrs. or longer. Serve
on lettuce leaves or with garnish of tomato and lemon.</p>


<h4>Broiled Trumese</h4>

<p>Lay slices of trumese on a well oiled hot, not burned, griddle
and brown delicately on both sides. Or, brush lightly with oil,
lay in a shallow pan and put into a hot oven. Or, broil in a
wire broiler over coals or over or under a gas blaze. Serve with
<a href="#sauce_6">sauce 6</a>, <a href="#sauce_12">12</a>, <a href="#sauce_16">16</a>, <a href="#sauce_17">17</a>, <a href="#sauce_51">51</a>, <a href="#sauce_54">54</a>, <a href="#sauce_57">57</a>, or <a href="#sauce_73">73</a><!--TN: commas were periods in this series--> or with almost any of the meat
<a id="Page_160" class="pagenum" title="160"> </a>
and vegetable sauces; with apple sauce, baked apples, lemon
apples or jelly; with green peas, string beans, creamed corn or
any creamed vegetables; with cabbage or celery in tomato or
with stewed onions. It may also be served on or around a
mound of boiled rice with lentil or brown gravy, or with pilau
or mashed Irish or sweet potatoes.</p>


<h4>Trumese&mdash;Jelly Sauce</h4>

<p>Add jelly or jelly and lemon juice to melted butter in a sauce
pan and when hot dip slices of broiled trumese in the sauce, lay
them on a platter and pour sauce over.</p>


<h4>Trumese and Italian Sauce on Biscuit or Dumplings</h4>

<p>Lay steamed dumplings or split biscuit on platter, pour hot
sauce over and cover or surround with slices of broiled trumese.</p>


<h4>★ Trumese with Poached Egg</h4>

<p>Broil round slices of trumese and serve with a nicely poached
egg on each slice. Do not forget the parsley garnish. The trumese
and soft poached egg make a delightful combination.
Cream sauce poured over the slices of trumese before the eggs
are put on makes a very rich dish.</p>


<h4>★ Trumese and Eggs</h4>

<p>Mix nut butter smooth with water or tomato, add chopped
ripe olives. Spread round slices of broiled trumese with the
mixture, just warm in oven and slide a nicely poached egg on to
each.</p>


<h4>★ Trumese with Mushrooms</h4>

<p>Lay slices of broiled trumese on platter with crisp toast points
surrounding. Place broiled mushrooms on trumese, pour hot
(not browned) melted butter over and serve.</p>


<h4>★ Trumese à la Mode</h4>

<p>Cook together chopped onion and carrot and fine sliced celery,
drain and spread over slices of broiled trumese which have been
<a id="Page_161" class="pagenum" title="161"> </a>
laid on an agate baking pan. Add a little fresh or stewed tomato,
a trifle of fresh or powdered thyme and a very little chopped
fresh mint. Sprinkle with chopped parsley. Mix salt, a little
celery salt, browned flour, butter or oil and hot water and pour
over all. Bake in a slow oven, covered part of the time. In
serving, lay trumese carefully on platter, cover with vegetables
remaining in pan and pour liquid, if any, over.</p>

<p>Parsley and sliced carrots make an appropriate garnish, but
the dish is well garnished of itself.</p>

<p>A whole brick-shaped loaf, or halves of round loaves laid the
flat side down in a pan, may be used instead of slices of trumese.</p>

<p>Vegetables may be put under as well as over the trumese.</p>

<p>The following combinations may be substituted for the one
given:</p>

<p>Chopped raw carrots and onion, thyme, bay leaf, browned
flour, butter and oil and consommé. Bake, covered most of the
time, when the raw vegetables are used. A gravy of nut butter,
tomato and water, thickened, may be used instead of the consommé.</p>

<p>Celery, carrots, turnips, onions, bay leaf, parsley, salt, browned
and white flour, oil or butter, water.</p>

<p>Onion, tomato, garlic, parsley, butter or oil, browned flour,
salt, water. This sauce may be thickened a little and the whole
served on boiled rice, the Mexican way.</p>


<h4>★ Trumese in Tomato</h4>

<p>This is one of the most satisfying preparations and is just as
good cold as warm.</p>

<p>Pour enough slightly salted, strained or unstrained stewed tomato
over the bottom of a granite pan to cover it well. Lay
¾ in. slices of trumese in the tomato and heat all in a moderate
oven until the trumese has absorbed the tomato and is well dried.
If too moist, the character is not developed. The pulp in the
pan is all the sauce that is required. Ripe olives are an excellent
accompaniment.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_162" class="pagenum" title="162"> </a>
Trumese with Onions</h4>

<p>Lay slices of broiled trumese in baking pan, cover with sliced
onions and sprinkle with salt mixed with browned flour. Pour
a little oil, melted butter or nut cream over. Add a little water
when necessary. Cover and bake until onions are tender. Remove
cover at the last. Make gravy of the remains in the pan
after trumese is removed by adding water and thickening. Strain
into a bowl or over trumese. May serve on boiled rice.</p>


<h4>Spanish Trumese</h4>

<p>Cover “Trumese with Onions” with stewed, or raw sliced,
tomatoes about ½ hour before it is done and make gravy the same.</p>


<h4>Trumese Smothered with Bananas</h4>

<p>Cover slices of broiled trumese with sliced bananas, sprinkle
lightly with salt, pour a little lemon juice over and bake until
bananas are soft. Serve hot or cold.</p>


<h4>Trumese Baked with Onion Dressing</h4>

<p>Place layers of broiled trumese in a pan with a little water, cover
with a dressing made in the proportion of 2 cups bread crumbs,
2 chopped onions, 1 level tablespn. butter or oil and 2 beaten eggs.
Bake, covered, ½ hour, uncover and brown on top grate. Make
gravy in pan by adding consommé and thickening, after the trumese
and dressing are removed. Or, lay slices of stale bread
over trumese, cover with sliced onions and a little oil, sprinkle
with salt and bake 1 hour covered.</p>


<h4>★ Trumese Cutlets</h4>

<p>Dip slices of trumese in egg beaten with salt and water, 1
teaspn. of water to each egg. Roll in fine zwieback, cracker or
bread crumbs. Brown in hot oven. Serve at once, plain or
with any desired sauce.</p>

<p>The yolk or white of egg only with salt and a teaspoon of water
may be used. Sometimes, substitute lemon juice for water
with the yolk.</p>

<p><a id="Page_163" class="pagenum" title="163"> </a>
Again, stir 2 level tablespns. raw nut butter with 1¾&ndash;2
tablespns. of water and add to 1 egg with salt and chopped onion
or any desired flavoring.</p>

<p>1&ndash;1½ tablespn. cream to an egg makes a rich dipping mixture.</p>


<h4>Lemon Rings&mdash;Parsley Butter</h4>

<p>Cream butter, add finely-chopped parsley and place paste in
pyramids in the center of thick slices of lemon; serve with plain
cutlets. Paste to be spread on hot cutlet and lemon squeezed
over by each individual. Many enjoy a mince of green onions
and garlic in the parsley butter.</p>


<h4>Imperial Cutlets</h4>

<p>Dip trumese in batter of 1 egg, 1 level tablespn. thick tomato
pulp, a little grated onion, browned flour and salt; then in crumbs.
Bake and serve with string beans or greens.</p>


<h4>Savory Cutlets&mdash;Mashed Potato</h4>

<p>Use salt, a trifle of sage and 1 tablespn. grated or chopped
onion (no water) with the egg. Crumb; bake, and serve on or
around mound of mashed potato with drawn butter.</p>


<h4>★ Batter Cutlets</h4>

<div class="title"><i>Batter</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 tablespns. oil</li>
  <li>3&ndash;4 tablespns. flour</li>
  <li>1½ cup boiling water</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>stale bread crumbs</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat but do not brown oil in sauce pan, stir in flour, add
water, stirring smooth. Remove from fire, add eggs and salt
and a few bread crumbs.</p>

<p>Broil slices of trumese on one side, turn and drop a small
spoonful of the batter on each. When broiled on the other side,
turn again, leaving the batter next to the griddle and drop another
spoonful on the trumese, turning again when the first batter
is delicately browned. Serve (without sauce) as soon as
second side is browned.</p>

<p>Or, drop spoonfuls of batter on a hot, well oiled baking pan,
<a id="Page_164" class="pagenum" title="164"> </a>
lay slices of broiled trumese on each and spread another spoonful
of batter on top of each slice; bake in a quick oven.</p>


<h4>★ Green Corn Cutlets</h4>

<div class="title"><i>Batter</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 tablespns. oil or butter</li>
  <li>3 tablespns. flour</li>
  <li>⅞ cup boiling water</li>
  <li>½&ndash;¾ cup grated or ground green corn</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. sugar if corn is old</li>
  <li>3 tablespns. dry or toasted bread crumbs</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook batter and use with trumese the same as batter cutlets.</p>


<h4>Batter No.&nbsp;2</h4>

<p>1 pt. grated corn (if canned, grind through food cutter), 2 eggs,
with dry or toasted bread crumbs to make a batter thick enough
to bake well, salt. If corn is dry, add a little milk or cream; if
very moist, add oil or butter only.</p>

<p>Use with trumese the same as batter cutlets.</p>


<h4>Ragout (Stew) of Trumese</h4>

<p>Thicken bouillon or consommé to the consistency of thin
cream. Add trumese cut into dice and simmer for 20 m. or
longer. Serve plain in tureen, or on toast, or in rice or mashed
potato border.</p>

<p>When noodles, or macaroni in any form are to be added to the
stew, simmer a bay leaf and more onion in the bouillon before
thickening; garlic also if liked.</p>

<p>One day we added some water drained from spinach to consommé,
thickened it and added a little cream,<!--TN: added comma--> the trumese and
some nutmese, and we had a choice combination.</p>


<h4>Ragout of Trumese No.&nbsp;2</h4>

<p>Trumese; onion, garlic, browned flour, tomato, bay leaf; juniper
berries crushed, one teaspoon to a quart of stew.</p>


<h4>Stewed Hashed Trumese</h4>

<p>Simmer hashed trumese in bouillon or consommé until just
moist. Serve on toast, thin crackers or rice: or put trumese
<a id="Page_165" class="pagenum" title="165"> </a>
into cream sauce and serve on toast with or without a poached
egg on each slice of toast.</p>


<h4>Trumese for Luncheon or Second Course</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. trumese in dice</li>
  <li>2 level tablespns. butter</li>
  <li>2 level tablespns. flour</li>
  <li>½ cup milk</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>½ cup cream</li>
  <li>2 hard boiled eggs</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. orange juice flavored with rind of orange</li>
  <li>½&ndash;1 teaspn. vanilla</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub butter and flour together over the fire, add milk and salt.
Rub the yolks of the eggs to a paste with the cream and stir
into the sauce, then add trumese and sliced whites of eggs.
Heat to just boiling, remove from fire, stir in quickly the flavored
orange juice and vanilla and serve at once. ½ cup mushrooms
may be added with the trumese. In that case, the mushroom
liquor may form a part of the liquid instead of the whole
half cup of milk.</p>


<h4>Trumese with Truffles and Mushrooms</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 tablespns. butter</li>
  <li>3 tablespns. flour</li>
  <li>1 pt. hot milk</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. grated onion</li>
  <li>2 truffles</li>
  <li>2 mushrooms</li>
  <li>yolks of 2 eggs</li>
  <li>rings of green onion tops or shreds of lettuce</li>
  <li>⅛&ndash;¼ teaspn. celery salt</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Melt butter in saucepan, add flour and milk, stirring until
smooth. Add the onion and yolks of eggs, then truffles and
mushrooms which have been cut into small pieces and simmered
(without browning) in butter, then the onion tops or shreds of
lettuce and the celery salt. Let all come nearly to the boiling point
and serve over broiled trumese without delay.</p>



<h4>★ Trumese and Mushrooms à la Crême</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 lb. trumese</li>
  <li>1 can (1 cup) mushrooms</li>
  <li>zwieback, cracker crumbs or granella</li>
  <li>3&ndash;4 tablespns. oil</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. chopped onion</li>
  <li>4&ndash;5 tablespns. flour</li>
  <li>¾ cup water</li>
  <li>½ cup cream</li>
  <li>¾ teaspn. salt</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="Page_166" class="pagenum" title="166"> </a>
Simmer onion (without browning) in oil, add flour, water,
cream and salt. When smooth, remove at once from fire and
mix in lightly the mushrooms in halves or quarters and the trumese
in small dice. Put into scallop dish, or pile in the center
of shells. Sprinkle lightly with crumbs or granella and bake in
a quick oven until a delicate brown and just heated through.
When shells are used they should be set in a dripping pan and
baked on top grate of oven. They must not bake too long. If
the shells are the large silver ones, they can be prettily garnished.
Serve on small plates, with delicate unfermented bread and celery
if desired. Small patty pan shells of pie paste may be used.</p>

<p>When this dish was served at a diplomatic dinner in Washington,
one of the guests pronounced it “sweetbreads” and could
not be convinced to the contrary.</p>

<p><b>Trumese and Celery à la Crême</b>&mdash;Substitute 1¼ cup (1¼ pt.
before cooking) stewed celery for the mushrooms; or for</p>

<p><b>Trumese and Macaroni à la Crême</b>&mdash;Use 1 cup small macaroni

<h4>Trumese en Casserole</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. onions, sliced or quartered</li>
  <li>1 pt. turnip diced</li>
  <li>1 pt. carrots, quartered and sliced</li>
  <li>¾&ndash;1 pt. celery, sliced</li>
  <li>3 tablespns. raw nut butter or meal</li>
  <li>¼ cup tomatoes</li>
  <li>1¾ cup water</li>
  <li>1&ndash;2 teaspns. browned flour</li>
  <li>2½&ndash;3 teaspns. salt</li>
  <li>1 bay leaf in small pieces</li>
  <li>slices of broiled trumese</li>
</ul>

<p>Put vegetables in pudding dish in order given, with a piece of
bay leaf occasionally. Mix butter, browned flour, salt, tomatoes
and hot water and pour over them. Lay slices of broiled
trumese over all; cover and bake in a rather hot oven 1&ndash;1¼ hour.<!--TN: added period-->
Sprinkle with chopped parsley. Set dish on large plate or tray,
<a id="Page_167" class="pagenum" title="167"> </a>
pin folded napkin around and send to table. If preferred,
thicken liquor slightly before pouring it over the vegetables,
and bake 15 m. longer.</p>


<h4>★ ★ Trumese Pie</h4>

<p>Sprinkle fine chopped onion and parsley in baking dish and
lay in slices of trumese (part nutmese if desired). Repeat the
same until about 1 lb. of trumese has been used. Sprinkle last
with onion and parsley.</p>

<p><i>Sauce</i>&mdash;Rub together 5 tablespns. oil or melted butter and 5
or 6 tablespns. of flour. Add 1 qt. of boiling water, boil up,
add salt and pour over trumese. When cool enough, cover with
biscuit of universal crust. Cover and let stand in a warm place
until crust is very light, then bake in a moderate oven about ¾ of
an hour. Cover with paper or asbestos sheet if the crust becomes
brown before baking is finished. It is well to have some
extra sauce to serve with the pie. This dish is a general favorite.
Finely-sliced celery or 1 teaspn. of celery salt or ¾ teaspn.
of sage may be substituted for the onion.</p>


<h4>★ Rice and Trumese Pie</h4>

<p>Boil 1 cup of rice in salted water. When done add ½ cup
of milk; spread over above pie instead of universal crust and
bake at once, covered most of the time. Use the 6 tablespns.
of flour in making sauce for rice crust.</p>

<p>Nicely seasoned, not too moist <i>mashed potato</i>, without egg,
may be used for crust. A little chopped parsley mixed with the
potato makes it more attractive.</p>

<p><i>A pastry crust</i> not quite so rich as for fruit pies is nice also;
put a small cup or mold in the center of the dish to hold it up.</p>

<p>Savory Sauce or Vegetable Gravy may be poured over
chopped or sliced trumese, and a nicely seasoned stuffing used
for the crust, for a different pie. Slices of hard boiled eggs may
be combined with trumese.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_168" class="pagenum" title="168"> </a>
All Ready Crusts</h4>

<p>When keeping house I nearly always have on hand crusts,
either raised or pastry, baked on tins about the size of my pudding
dish, so that I can lay them over the top of pie fillings or a
nicely seasoned stew and just heat them through in the oven.
Small pastry crusts, the size of individual dishes, are very convenient
sometimes.</p>


<h4>Trumese Shortcake&mdash;Italian Sauce</h4>

<p>Add trumese in small dice to hot Italian sauce; heat to
boiling and pour over split hot shortcake crust, in two layers.</p>

<p>Serve shortcake on chop tray or platter, suitably garnished.</p>

<p>Cream of mushroom or Boundary Castle sauce may be used
the same.</p>


<h4>Trumese Scallop with Cracker Crumbs</h4>

<p>Sprinkle cracker crumbs in bottom of dish with chopped onion
and the least bit of powdered sage. Pour a little sauce
No.&nbsp;41 over and cover with a thin layer of minced trumese.
Continue these layers, pour a larger quantity of sauce over the
last layer of trumese, then sprinkle with crumbs, dot with butter
and bake till well heated through and delicately browned
over the top.</p>

<p>Onion and sage may be omitted. Zwieback crumbs may be
used instead of cracker, and sauce No.&nbsp;8 or 46 in place of 41 for
other scalloped dishes.</p>


<h4>Trumese Pot Pie</h4>

<p>Well oil the inside of a kettle. Place in it the filling and
crust for trumese pie, making the sauce with 1 or 2 tablespns.
less of flour. When crust is light, set the kettle covered tight,
over a moderate fire, and when it comes to the boiling point let
it just simmer for 30&ndash;35 m. without removing the cover. It may
be necessary to very carefully place an asbestos pad under the
kettle during the latter part of the cooking. Serve with dumplings

around edge of platter, and trumese with gravy in center.</p>

<p>The dumplings may be steamed on a pie pan (perforated if
convenient) and laid over the filling which has been baked in a
pudding dish as for trumese pie.</p>

<p>A nicely seasoned trumese stew may be served with a border
of small steamed dumplings, and other varieties of pot pie may
be made according to taste and convenience.</p>


<h4>★ Trumese Boiled Dinner&mdash;New England Style</h4>

<p>Raw nut butter, a little browned flour and tomato, salt, carrots
in 1&ndash;2 in. lengths, according to thickness, turnips in sections
or thick slices, cabbage in quarters or eighths according to size, 1
beet (white if possible), pared and cut into four pieces, onions,
whole, cut at right angles ⅓ of the way up from the root end,
potatoes pared and cut into equal sizes, winter squash in large
pieces, pared, slices of broiled trumese, parsley.</p>

<p>Oil the bottom of the kettle. Mix in it the nut butter,
browned flour, salt and tomato, adding as much boiling water as
necessary to cook the dinner. When the liquid is boiling put
in the cabbage, carrots, turnips and beet. In about an hour,
add the onions; then in ¾ of an hour the potatoes, with the
squash laid inside down over the whole. When all are done,
if you have a very large platter, lay pieces of squash around the
edge with cabbage overlapping and the other vegetables in the
center, with slices of broiled trumese around and sprays of parsley
for garnish. The liquid remaining in the kettle, with a little
water added if necessary, may be strained and served as
gravy for the vegetables. The more nearly dry the vegetables
can cook without scorching the better, <em>but do not let them scorch</em>.
The squash need not be used, but it would not be a boiled dinner
to a New Englander without it.</p>

<p>Steamed dumplings may be served with the dinner.</p>


<h4>Timbales of Rice&mdash;Trumese Stuffing</h4>

<p>Line a well oiled mold ½&ndash;1 inch deep (according to size of
<a id="Page_170" class="pagenum" title="170"> </a>
mold) with hot cooked rice. Fill nearly to top with mixture of
Elsa’s roll, spread rice over top. Cover with oiled lid and
steam ½&ndash;¾ of an hour. Serve with <a href="#sauce_8">sauce 8</a>, <a href="#sauce_12">12</a>, <a href="#sauce_36">36</a> or <a href="#sauce_48">48</a>, or
any desired sauce.</p>

<p>Hot hominy grits (which have been cooked 2&ndash;3 hrs. in double
boiler in proportion of 1 cup of grits to 3 of water) may be used
in place of rice; also cold boiled macaroni chopped fine, with 1
egg added to each pint of macaroni.</p>


<h4>★ Trumese Timbale&mdash;Boundary Castle Sauce</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1¾ cup stale (or 1 good cup dry) bread crumbs</li>
  <li>1 cup hot water</li>
  <li>½ lb. trumese</li>
  <li>¼ cup raw nut butter</li>
  <li>¼ teaspn. powdered bay leaf</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. powdered sage</li>
  <li>½&ndash;¾ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
</ul>

<p>The nut butter may be omitted and 2 cups of stale (1¼ dry)
crumbs used. Use the crust as well as the center of the loaf of
bread. Soak crumbs in the water until soft, then stir over the
fire until smooth and dry enough to leave the sides of the pan.
Remove from the fire, add trumese chopped fine, bay leaf, sage,
salt, nut butter and yolks of eggs. Beat until well mixed and if
convenient rub through a fine colander, then add the whites of
the eggs beaten a little. Press into a well oiled mold, which
may have been garnished with truffles, and steam 1½ hour. Let
stand a moment after taking from the steamer, then invert upon
the center of the platter. Serve with Boundary Castle sauce,
which is the crowning feature of the dish.</p>

<p>The timbales may be made in a round mold, or in individual
molds and served on a chop tray. Omit herbs if preferred. If
truffles are used for garnishing, the cuttings may be<!--TN: added 'be'--> chopped and
added to the loaf.</p>


<h4>★ Trumese and Rice Timbale, Roast or Loaf</h4>

<p>This is one of the simplest and most convenient preparations,
and is as delicious as it is convenient.
<a id="Page_171" class="pagenum" title="171"> </a></p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 cups minced trumese</li>
  <li>2 cups boiled or steamed rice</li>
  <li>⅛&ndash;¼ cup of oil or melted butter</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix the ingredients thoroughly and put into a timbale mold
or brick shaped bread tin, a covered can, or individual molds;
steam, or bake in pan of water (covered until the last) ¾&ndash;1½
hour according to size of loaf. Serve with creamed celery, peas,
some of the mushroom sauces, a plain cream or any desired sauce.</p>


<h4>Rice Timbale&mdash;Trumese and Asparagus Tips</h4>

<p>Partly fill buttered timbale mold, round or oblong, with hot,
nicely cooked rice. Unmold on to tray or platter, surround with
slices of broiled trumese standing against the sides of the mold.
Pour a little drawn butter around on the dish, and lay clusters
of cooked asparagus tips around the edge. Serve with plenty of
the sauce. Sauce may be flavored with onion and parsley.</p>


<h4>Elsa’s Roll of Trumese</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>3 pts. minced trumese</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>1 cup cracker dust or granella</li>
  <li>½ cup milk</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Shape into a large roll; bake ½ hour, basting occasionally
with oil or butter, and water. Serve with any desired sauce or
accompaniment.</p>


<h4>Cannelon of Trumese</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. minced trumese (or part nutmese)</li>
  <li>1⅓ tablespn. butter or oil</li>
  <li>1&ndash;3 teaspns. chopped onion</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. chopped parsley</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Form into roll, cover with pastry crust, fastening well at the
ends, and bake in moderate oven 20&ndash;30 m. Serve with 16, 34
or any desired sauce. Shelled whole hard boiled eggs may be
put into the center of the roll for a novelty, when desired.</p>


<h4>Trumese Rissoles, Pasties or Turnovers</h4>

<p>Cut pastry crust into circles the size of a large saucer or small
plate. Lay a spoonful of the filling of Cannelon of Trumese on
one side of each; fold the other side over (after moistening
<a id="Page_172" class="pagenum" title="172"> </a>
edges) like a turnover. Bake. Nice for travelling lunches.</p>


<h4>★ Trumese Soufflé</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. chopped or ground trumese</li>
  <li>1 cup milk</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. flour</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. butter</li>
  <li>4 eggs</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir flour smooth with part of the milk, heat the remainder to
boiling, add flour and cook until thickened. Remove from fire and
add butter, trumese, salt and beaten yolks of eggs; then chop in
the stiffly-beaten whites. Put into baking dish, custard cups or
molds. Set into pan of hot water and bake (covered part of the
time with oiled paper) in slow oven 20&ndash;30 m., or until firm in
the center. ¼ nutmese may be used.</p>


<h4>★ Trumese Croquettes</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½ lb. trumese</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. celery salt, or</li>
  <li>1½ tablespn. fine cut celery</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. grated onion</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. powdered sage</li>
  <li>2 teaspns. chopped parsley</li>
</ul>

<p>Chop trumese fine, mix with other ingredients, stand in cool
place until sauce is made.</p>

<div class="title"><i>Sauce</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 tablespns. oil</li>
  <li>⅓ cup browned flour No.&nbsp;1</li>
  <li>½ cup white flour</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. grated onion</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. browned flour No.&nbsp;3</li>
  <li>¼ cup strained tomato</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix onion, browned flour No.&nbsp;3, salt and tomato in pint measure,
fill the measure with boiling water. Heat the oil, rub half
the flour into it, add the boiling liquid, and when smooth, add
the remainder of the flour, stirring well; cook thoroughly over a
slow fire. Remove from fire, chop in lightly the trumese mixture
and cool. When cold, shape into rolls about three inches
long and 1 inch in diameter, roll in fine toasted bread or cracker
crumbs, dip in beaten egg and roll again in crumbs. Bake in
quick oven 10 m., or until croquettes begin to crack a little and
are a delicate brown.<!--TN: changed comma to period--> If baked too long, or if they stand long
after baking they will lose their shape. Serve plain, or with
mushroom sauce, or jelly, or jellied cranberries, or with peas
creamed, or seasoned with butter and salt only. Well made
<a id="Page_173" class="pagenum" title="173"> </a>
croquettes require no sauce. I sometimes plan to have creamed
potatoes with trumese croquettes.</p>

<p>This quantity will make twelve croquettes. They may be
shaped into cones if preferred.</p>

<p>In making more than once the recipe, use a little extra flour,
as the evaporation is less in proportion. One secret of success
with croquettes is to have the mixture as soft as possible to shape.
In shaping, drop the soft mixture on to the crumbs by spoonfuls,
lift carefully from beneath (so as not to get any of the crumbs
inside the croquettes), and shape deftly with the fingers; then
roll in the crumbs, taking care that the ends are well covered.
Drop from one hand to the other to remove the loose crumbs
and lay croquettes on a plate or board until all are crumbed the
first time. (With some mixtures, the fingers may be dipped in
oil and the croquettes shaped neatly before putting into the
crumbs). For dipping, have eggs beaten slightly with salt and
water, 1 teaspn. of water to each egg. Dip the croquettes into
the mixture with the left hand only, see that the ends are moistened
with the egg, drop on to a flat dish of crumbs, with the
right hand roll them until they are well covered, and lay on to
the pans in which they are to be baked.</p>

<p>All ready croquettes may be kept in a cold place for a day or
two before baking when necessary.</p>


<h4>★ Trumese Croquettes No.&nbsp;2</h4>

<p>Chop or grind trumese to make ¾&ndash;1 qt. Add 1½&ndash;2 teaspns.
salt, 2 tablespns. each chopped parsley and grated onion. Fine
cut celery may be used instead of onion.</p>

<p><i>Sauce</i>&mdash;Rub to a smooth paste 5½ tablespns. of flour and
2&ndash;3 of butter or oil. Pour 1 pt. of boiling milk over slowly,
stirring. Boil well, add trumese, mix, cool. When cold, form
into croquettes, dip in egg, roll in crumbs, bake.</p>


<h4>★ Brother Barnett’s Savory Trumese and Rice Croquettes</h4>

<p>Use recipe for Trumese and Rice Timbale, <a href="#Page_170">p.&nbsp;170</a>. Flavor with sage
<a id="Page_174" class="pagenum" title="174"> </a>
or winter savory, shape into croquettes, bake. Serve with sauce
4, 9, 12, 44 or 54. You will be surprised to see how nice these
are. Cooked hominy grits or chopped boiled macaroni may be
used in place of rice.</p>


<h4>Russian Croquettes</h4>

<p>Cover small rolls of Elsa’s roll, <a href="#Page_171">p.&nbsp;171</a>, or of filling for cannelon
of trumese, <a href="#Page_171">p.&nbsp;171</a>, with pastry crust. Bake. Serve with eighths
of red apples, sections of orange or with baked bananas, or with
any suitable sauce or vegetable.</p>


<h4>★ Trumese and Potato Hash</h4>

<p>Put trumese and double the quantity of cold potatoes (those
cooked in their jackets until nearly tender being ideal) through
food cutter, using next to the coarsest cutter. (If chopping by
hand, be sure not to chop too fine, especially the potatoes.)
Mix carefully. Simmer <em>without browning</em>, chopped onion in oil.
Add the mixed trumese and potato, pour consommé or nicely
seasoned gravy over and set in the oven to heat, and brown
over the top. If obliged to finish on top of the stove, set back,
on an asbestos pad, and heat slowly, covered.</p>

<p>The onion may be mixed with the trumese and potato, all put
into a baking dish, nut butter stirred to a cream with consommé
poured over and the hash baked for ¾&ndash;1 hour. Finely-sliced
celery, celery salt, or any of the sweet herbs, powdered, may be
substituted for the onion. Sage may be used occasionally with
the onion.</p>


<h4>Trumese and Rice Hash</h4>

<p>Use boiled or steamed rice in place of potato in the preceding
recipe.</p>


<h3 id="NUTMESE">NUTMESE</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½ lb. Virginia peanuts, raw</li>
  <li>1 lb. Virginia peanuts, cooked</li>

water, mix well, put into oiled tins. Steam 5 hrs. or bake 1 hr.
<a id="Page_175" class="pagenum" title="175"> </a>
in slow oven on asbestos pad. May cook in sealed glass jars,
following directions <a href="#Page_156">p.&nbsp;156</a>, for trumese in glass jars.</p>

<p>Use a trifle less water for Spanish peanuts.</p>

<p>Cereal coffee or consommé may be used in place of water.</p>

<p>All ready prepared foods similar to nutmese are variously
named “nuttolene”, “nutmete”,<!--TN: added comma--> “nutcysa” and “nut loaf,” according
to where they are made.</p>


<h4>Tomato Nutmese</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>¼ lb. Virginia peanuts, raw</li>
  <li>1 lb. Virginia peanuts, cooked</li>
  <li>2 teaspns. salt</li>
  <li>5&ndash;5⅓ tablespns. thick tomato pulp (strained tomato cooked down)</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook same as nutmese, having oven <em>very</em> slow in baking.</p>


<h4>Cornstarch Nutmese</h4>

<p>The following recipe makes a very palatable preparation for
those who can use the starch; but meat substitutes should be
made without starch.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>3 cups raw Spanish nut meal, or coarse butter</li>
  <li>1 cup cornstarch</li>
  <li>3&ndash;3½ teaspns. salt</li>
  <li>1 cup cold water</li>
  <li>3 cups boiling water</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir dry ingredients with the cold water, then add the boiling
water gradually, stirring. Cook the same as nutmese. Use a
little more water with Virginia nuts. See suggestion <a href="#Page_155">p.&nbsp;155</a>,
for using starch washed out of gluten dough, in place of corn
starch.</p>


<h3 id="NUTMESE_DISHES">NUTMESE DISHES</h3>

<p>Nutmese of nuts only, is suitable to serve with breads of all
kinds instead of butter. It takes the place of cheese nicely with
apple pie and may be served sliced, with Chili, apple, grape and
different fruit sauces or with jelly.</p>



<h4>Nutmese Cottage Cheese</h4>

<p>Take the broken pieces of nutmese left from slicing, press
them through a wire strainer, add salt and enough lemon juice
<a id="Page_176" class="pagenum" title="176"> </a>
to give the slight tartness of cottage cheese. Use plenty of salt
and not too much lemon juice. Mix well and press through the
strainer again. Shape into balls and roll in chopped parsley.</p>

<p>Carefully <b>Broiled Nutmese</b> may be served with creamed parsnips
or celery on toast, or with mint sauce, tomato and tomato
cream sauce, and nearly all the sauces and vegetables with which
trumese is served. It is especially nice with green peas.</p>


<h4>Tomato Nutmese and Eggs</h4>

<p>Lay ¼ inch slices of broiled tomato nutmese on thin pieces
of toast of the same shape and place a soft poached egg on each.
Garnish with parsley.</p>

<p>Use soft scrambled eggs instead of poached sometimes.</p>


<h4>Nutmese and Rice with Peas Sauce</h4>

<p>Add chopped parsley and cooked green peas to tomato cream
sauce which has been flavored with onion, and pour sauce over
a low, rocky mound of rice surrounded by broiled nutmese.</p>


<h4>Nutmese with Baked Beans</h4>

<p>Score nutmese of the desired shape, on one side. Broil the
scored side carefully and set in the oven to just warm through.
Place in center of platter, pile baked beans around and garnish
with parsley and lemon. Nutmese made in an oblong, square-cornered
tin would be very suitable in shape.</p>

<p>String beans which have been cooked whole with raw nut
butter in the water may be used in place of baked beans, and
French dressing or Sauce Amèricaine poured over.</p>

<p>★ <b>Nutmese Cutlets</b> are made the same as trumese cutlets,
<a href="#Page_162">p.&nbsp;162</a>, except that nutmese cutlets are better with granella
than with bread crumbs.</p>


<h4>★ Nut Irish Stew&mdash;a universal favorite</h4>

<p>In 2 qts. of salted water to which have been added 4 or 5
tablespns. of raw nut butter, cook from 4&ndash;6 large onions sliced
<a id="Page_177" class="pagenum" title="177"> </a>
thin, and 3 pts. to 2 qts. of potato cut into irregular pieces about
an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>When the potatoes have cooked enough to give a little consistency
to the stew, drop in pieces of nutmese in strips about
1½ in. long and ¾ in. thick. Heat without stirring. Serve.</p>


<h4>Nutmese in Cream of Tomato Sauce</h4>

<p>makes a delightful stew. It may be served alone, on toast, in
rice border, or in mashed bean border. Cut nutmese into dice
and add to sauce just long enough before serving to heat through.
Do not stir.</p>

<p>Add nutmese to Cream of Spinach soup when you have some
left over and you have an enjoyable meat dish with very little
trouble.</p>


<h4>Nutmese and Green Peas with New Potatoes</h4>

<p>Serve in cream or drawn butter sauce. Old potatoes cut in
small pieces may be used.</p>


<h4>Nutmese à la Crême</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">

dish, in layers, with sauce on top. Sprinkle with crumbs,
corn meal or browned flour No.&nbsp;1. Bake in moderate oven until
bubbling all through and delicately browned on top.</p>

<p>We sometimes use a little garlic, and sometimes a little cream
<a id="Page_178" class="pagenum" title="178"> </a>
with a very little strained tomato in the sauce. Another is
made with the following sauce and finished the same as the
preceding:</p>

<p><i>Sauce No.&nbsp;2</i>&mdash;Rub ⅞ cup pastry flour smooth with water;
pour it gradually into 1 pt. of boiling milk, stirring until smooth.
Pour this over 2 beaten eggs or yolks only. Add 1 teaspn. each
chopped onion and parsley, and ¾&ndash;1 teaspn. salt.</p>

<p>The sauce must be very stiff or the character of the dish is
spoiled.</p>

<p>A tablespn. of butter may be added when the sauce is taken
from the fire, if desired richer.</p>


<h4>Nutmese and Oyster Plant in Shells</h4>

<p>Use nutmese and oyster plant in place of trumese and mushrooms,
in Trumese and Mushrooms à la Crême, and the liquor
in which the oyster plant was cooked instead of water in the
sauce.</p>

with nicely seasoned mashed potato. Pour a little cream, oil or
melted butter over and bake until top is delicately browned.</p>

<p>Sprinkle with chopped parsley, or, chopped parsley may be
<a id="Page_179" class="pagenum" title="179"> </a>
mixed with the potato. Universal or rice crust may be used.</p>


<h4>Hashed Potato Crust for Nutmese</h4>

<p>Use sauce No.&nbsp;9 with nutmese and cover with well seasoned
hashed or hashed creamed potatoes and brown in oven.</p>


<h4>Nutmese and Potato Pie with Pastry Crust</h4>

it chunks or slices of fresh boiled potato, lay thin slices of nutmese
over, cover with pastry crust and bake in moderate oven.</p>


<h4>Apple and Nutmese Pie</h4>

<p>Make the same as apple pie, using enough less apple to make
room for a layer of nutmese, and only about half as much sugar.
Serve for luncheon or early supper.</p>


<h4>Nutmese Croquettes or Patties</h4>

<p>Use nutmese in recipe of trumese croquettes, No.&nbsp;2. Shape
into patties if preferred. Serve with green peas or on a bed of

<h3 id="ROASTS">ROASTS</h3>

<p>Roasts are among the most popular of vegetarian dishes. In
the home, in sanitariums and in our vegetarian restaurants they
are always in demand. Except soups there are no dishes that
we are so often asked to give the recipes for as our roasts. We
always plan to have left-overs that will be good for them, as
the proper combination of different ingredients is very satisfying,
and richer flavors are often developed by reheating foods.</p>

<p>When we start to make a roast, we gather up the suitable
ingredients: for instance, a few baked beans or mashed lentils,
a little cold boiled rice, some tomato macaroni, a nut cutlet or
two, perhaps one or two croquettes, a spoonful or so of tomato,
some boiled onions, a few peas or string beans or baked peanuts,
may be a little corn, and the vegetables strained out of a soup
from the day before; throwing them one after another into a
pan. Then we often add a handful of nut meats, chopped or
whole, a little sage, sometimes sliced celery or chopped onion,
occasionally a little browned flour; never potatoes unless an infinitesimal
quantity. Then we scatter over some coarse bread
or zwieback crumbs or granella and pour on consommé, broth or
gravy, some soup we happen to have, or water, and add one or
more beaten eggs, according to the number and size of the
loaves; just enough to hold the ingredients together. The eggs
may be omitted, but we are more sure that the roast will turn
<a id="Page_182" class="pagenum" title="182"> </a>
out of the tin well without being too solid, by using them; then,
too, they add to the nutritive value of the roast.</p>

<p>Mix well, but not to pastiness, adding more crumbs or liquid
as required to make a rather soft mixture. Allowance must be
made for the swelling of the crumbs, if they are very dry, and
the thickening of the eggs. More salt may be necessary but not
much if the foods were seasoned before. The roast should
not be as salt as the gravy that is to be served with it.</p>

<p>When of the desired consistency put the mixture into well
oiled molds or brick shaped tins, taking care that the corners
are well filled. Brush the tops with oil or melted butter or
pour a little thin cream over. Bake in a moderate oven in a
dripping pan or covered baker without water until the roast is
well heated through and the eggs set, then pour boiling water
into the baker, cover and bake for an hour or so longer. Remove
from oven, let stand a few minutes, invert on platter,
lifting mold carefully, garnish, and send to table with a suitable
sauce. Some of the meaty flavored sauces are most appropriate.
The pieces of nut meat in the roast add much to the pleasure of
masticating it. Roasts may be warmed over by setting in pan
of hot water in the oven.</p>


<h4>Cutlets of Roast</h4>

<p>Cut cold roast into not too thin slices. Egg and crumb, or
flour only. Bake or broil and serve with or without a sauce.
Some such accompaniment as stewed onions or carrots is enjoyable.
Cutlets may be served on a bed of pilau.</p>

<p>Below are given the ingredients of a few roasts that were
made in a small institution at different times.</p>


<h5>No. 1</h5>

<p>Some macaroni strained out of the soup from the day before,
a little nutmese à la crême, some trumese cutlets, hard boiled
eggs, a little nutmese, sage, crumbs, eggs, consommé. The
nutmese was put in the center of the loaf in a layer.</p>


<h5><a id="Page_183" class="pagenum" title="183"> </a>
No. 2</h5>

<p>Stewed red kidney beans ground, egg macaroni ground, dry
zwieback ground, a few nuts, eggs, consommé, nutmese in
layers. Served with Sauce Imperial.</p>


<h5>No. 3</h5>

<h3 id="LEGUMES"><a id="Page_184" class="pagenum" title="184"> </a>
LEGUMES</h3>

<p>The mature, dry seeds only are considered under this head.</p>

<p>Legumes&mdash;peas, beans and lentils form an important part of
the vegetarian dietary, containing as they do a so much larger
proportion of the muscle-building material than flesh meats, and
being at the same time inexpensive.</p>

<p>Another advantage is that they are grown in considerable variety
in nearly all countries.</p>

<p>We have beans&mdash;white, large and small; colored, of all shades
and sizes; peas&mdash;dry, green and yellow, split and whole, chick
peas and other varieties; lentils&mdash;German or Austrian, red or
Egyptian. The ground nut or peanut is also a legume.</p>

<p>Chick peas are found in the Italian groceries or macaroni
stores. They have a rich flavor peculiar to themselves.</p>

<p>The Soy bean, most common in China and India, has almost
no starch and is richer in oil than any other legume.</p>

<p>The legumes require a prolonged, slow cooking to render them
digestible and to develop their rich flavors. The hulls of some
are difficult of digestion. It is for this reason that we suggest
rubbing legumes through a colander in so many recipes. Experiments
have proven, also, that a larger percentage of their nutritive
value is assimilated when the hulls are excluded.</p>

<p>Parboiling causes beans to be flat and tasteless; then the need
is felt of a piece of pork or at least a lump of butter; while if
they are put at once, without soaking, into the water in which
they are to be cooked, their own rich, characteristic flavor
(which nothing can replace) will be retained.</p>

<p>The large, dark flowering beans and a few other colored ones
are exceptions, and should be parboiled, as their flavor is so rich
that it may be denominated “strong.”</p>

<p>Nearly all legumes for stewing or baking should be put into
boiling salted water (most authorities to the contrary notwithstanding),
to keep them from cooking to pieces and to preserve
their color and flavor. In sections where the altitude is great,
<a id="Page_185" class="pagenum" title="185"> </a>
however, legumes must be soaked for several hours and be put
to cooking in cold, soft water; even then a longer time will be
required for cooking than nearer the sea level.</p>

<p>The water may be rendered soft by boiling and settling, if
necessary. Soft or distilled water will cause legumes to be more
digestible at any altitude. Rain water is the very best. Most
legumes about double in bulk in cooking.</p>


<h4>★ Mashed Lentils</h4>

<p>“Rice is good, but lentils are my life.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">Hindu proverb</i>.</p>

<p>Do not waste time by looking lentils over by handfuls, but
put them into a large, flat colander, give them a shake or two to
remove the fine dirt, slide them to one side of the colander,
then with the fingers draw a few at a time toward you, looking
for particles of sand or gravel. Pick these out but do not pay
any attention to the wheat, chaff or poor lentils. Those will
come out in the washing in much less time than it takes to pick
them out and if a grain or two of wheat is left it will do no harm.</p>

<p>When you are sure all the gravel is out, set the colander into
a dish pan and pour cold water over the lentils. Stir with the
hand until all but the waste matter has settled to the bottom;
then carefully pour the water off. Repeat the process until all
objectionable substances are removed. Rinse the colander up
and down in water, drain the lentils and put immediately into a
large quantity of boiling water in a broad-bottomed vessel. (The
shape of the utensil has much to do with the drying out without
scorching.)</p>

<p>Let the lentils boil fast for a short time, then simmer without
stirring. If they are stirred after they begin to soften they will
scorch. Now keep the vessel over a slow, even fire until the
lentils are well dried out. The drying may be finished in the
oven if the dish is covered so the lentils will not become hard
on the top. This drying is imperative. It develops a rich flavor
that we do not get without it.</p>

<p><a id="Page_186" class="pagenum" title="186"> </a>
When well dried, add a little water and rub the lentils, a few
at a time, through a fine colander with a potato masher. (Do
not deceive yourself by thinking that you can get along faster by
putting a large quantity into the colander at once.)</p>

<p>Throw the hulls into a dish of boiling water. At the last,
stir the hulls well and rub again in the colander, reserving what
goes through this time for soups and gravies.</p>

<p>When all the lentils are through the colander (of course care
should be taken to keep them hot during the process), add plenty of
salt and beat until smooth and creamy. Keep hot in a double
boiler, covered, till serving time. Beat again just before serving.
Serve piled in rocky form or in smooth mound on hot platter
(or in a hot covered dish if to be long on the table), with different
garnishes: a wreath of celery tops, sprays of parsley or
chervil, spinach leaves or cooked vegetables. Serve with sauce
16, 17, 53 or 54.</p>

<p>Do not be afraid of the simple dishes; they are the best.</p>

dipped in cold water, in straight or irregular layers. Press down
close, cover and set in a cold place until firm. Unmold and
slice, or, send loaf to table whole on platter garnished with lettuce
or spinach leaves. Pass Improved Mayonnaise (with
chopped parsley) or French dressing, olive oil or Chili sauce.
This makes a good summer Sabbath dinner dish.</p>

<p>The Salad Entrée dressing is delightful with mashed legumes.</p>


<h4>★ Peas Pie&mdash;Corn Crust</h4>

<div class="title"><i>Crust</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 cans (1 qt., 16 ears) of corn not very moist</li>
  <li>2 or 3 eggs</li>

<h4>Mashed Peas&mdash;Macaroni or Vermicelli</h4>

<p>Cook macaroni or vermicelli with garlic, or onion and garlic.
Put into thick cream sauce and serve around rocky mound of
mashed peas.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_188" class="pagenum" title="188"> </a>
Creamed Beans</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pint white beans</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. butter</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. flour</li>
  <li>1 large cup milk</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>crumbs</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook and mash beans according to directions for mashed lentils;
add salt, and cream sauce made with butter, flour and milk;
then eggs beaten. Turn into oiled baking dish, sprinkle with<!--TN: deleted double 'with'-->
crumbs, bake a delicate brown, serve at once. The eggs
may be omitted but the beans are delightfully light with them.</p>

<p>Colored beans, peas and lentils may be prepared in the same
way.</p>


<h4>Lentils&mdash;Poached Eggs</h4>

<p>Spread a half-inch layer of mashed lentils on slightly moistened
rounds of toast and place a nicely poached egg on each.
Garnish.</p>


<h4>Bean Croquettes</h4>

<p>Shape dry mashed beans into thick croquettes (oiling the hands
or dipping them in hot water occasionally), coat delicately with
oil or melted butter, heat in oven till beginning to crack a little,
no more. Sprinkle with chopped parsley, serve with Sauce
Amèricaine, Sauce Imperial, or Mayonnaise or French dressing,
or with a garnish of lemon rings with parsley butter, <a href="#Page_163">p.&nbsp;163</a>.
Any seasoning but salt in the croquettes spoils them.</p>


<h4>Lentil Croquettes</h4>

<p>Prepare the same as bean croquettes, serve with any sauce
given for mashed lentils, or with small boiled onions sometimes.
A little browned flour and chopped onion may be used in the
croquettes. Rice and lentil croquettes may be served with Boundary
Castle sauce.</p>


<h4>Peas Croquettes</h4>

<p>Shape the same as bean croquettes, adding a little finely-sliced
tender celery if desired. Serve with sauces given for
mashed peas. The croquettes are very pretty rolled in parsley
<a id="Page_189" class="pagenum" title="189"> </a>
before baking. Chop the parsley, not too fine, and spread it
out thin with spaces between the particles on a vegetable board.
Roll the croquettes over it once.</p>


<h4>Legume Patties</h4>

<p>Shape mashed peas, beans or lentils into thick flat cakes instead
of into croquettes, and serve with suitable sauces.</p>


<h4>Peas Timbales</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup mashed peas</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>a few drops of onion juice</li>
  <li>½ tablespn. melted butter or 1 of cream</li>
  <li>⅔ teaspn. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix all with beaten eggs, bake in a single or in individual
molds well oiled, in pan of hot water until firm.</p>

<p>(Very finely sliced celery may be used instead of onion juice.
Peas and eggs only may be used for plain timbales). Serve with
cream sauce. Finely sliced celery, a few whole green peas, a
little stewed corn or a few pieces of tomato pulp may be added
to the sauce.</p>

<p>The individual timbales may be used as a garnish for some
vegetable dish, giving meat value to it. Decorate timbales with
egg daisies, carrots, or anything desired.</p>


<h4>Rice and Lentil Timbales</h4>

<p>Line a well oiled mold with a ¾ in. layer of boiled rice. Nearly
fill the center with mashed lentils, cover with rice, steam or bake
20 m. to ½ hr. Unmold carefully, garnish, serve with cream,
brown, mushroom or any suitable sauce.</p>

<p>Mashed peas may take the place of lentils, with sauce of celery,
onion or tomato cream.</p>


<h4>Lentil Roast</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. lentils</li>
  <li>½ cup raw nut butter</li>
  <li>a few bread crumbs, or</li>
  <li>¼ cup browned flour No.&nbsp;1</li>
  <li>1 small onion chopped</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>sage</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>⅝&ndash;¾ cup water</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook and mash lentils, add nut butter and onion which have
<a id="Page_190" class="pagenum" title="190"> </a>
been cooked with salt ½ hour in the water, then the browned
flour or the crumbs, sage and beaten egg; more salt and water
or crumbs if necessary for right consistency. Press into well
oiled mold or brick-shaped tin, bake, covered, in pan of water
about 1 hour or until firm. Dry in oven 10 m., out of water if
necessary. Let stand in warm place 5 m. Unmold on to platter,
garnish. Serve with <a href="#sauce_6">sauce 6</a>, <a href="#sauce_16">16</a>, <a href="#sauce_18">18</a>,<!--TN: changed periods to commas in this series--> <a href="#sauce_54">54</a> or <a href="#sauce_57">57</a>.</p>

<p>Flavorings of roast may be varied or omitted.</p>

<p>1 cup chopped nuts might be used in place of raw nut butter.</p>

<p>1 cup stewed tomato may be used for liquid.</p>

<p>For people with good digestion, the lentils may be ground
through a food cutter instead of being put through the colander.</p>


<h4>Chick Peas Roast</h4>

<p>Substitute<!--TN: was 'Subtitute'--> chick peas for lentils in lentil roast.</p>


<h4>Peas Roast</h4>

<p>1 pt. mashed, dry, split or whole green peas, 1 to 2 eggs or
whites of eggs only, or a little fresh cracker dust. Bake as
lentil roast until firm only. Serve with tomato cream sauce or
almond cream, tomato or celery cream sauce. Peas require no
flavoring, but celery or celery salt may be added, serving with
plain cream sauce.</p>


<h4>Sister Boulter’s Red Kidney Bean Loaf</h4>

<p>Cook and crush or grind red kidney beans, add salt and sage,
mold. Serve cold, sliced, with or without oil, or use for sandwiches.
A few crumbs may be added if necessary, the loaf baked,
and served hot with any suitable accompaniment.</p>


<h4>Purées of Legumes</h4>

<p>Add sufficient water, nut or dairy cream or milk to mashed
beans, peas or lentils to make of the consistency of a thick
batter. No sauce is required.</p>


<h4>★ Rich Baked Beans</h4>

<p>Wash beans and get them into boiling salted water, in
<a id="Page_191" class="pagenum" title="191"> </a>
the bean pot, as quickly as possible. For each pint of beans
use 1¼ to 1¾ teaspn. of salt. Add plenty of water at first,
perhaps three times the quantity of beans. Put into a hot oven
until they begin to boil, then reduce the temperature to such a
degree as will keep them just simmering for from 12 to 24 hours.
The old-fashioned New England baked beans were kept in a
brick oven for three days, and each day they were better than
the last.</p>

<p>Do not stir the beans after the skins begin to break. When
necessary to add more water, pour it boiling over the top and
let it settle in gradually. A gentle shaking may be helpful.
After they are swollen and softened they should not have too
much water on at a time, nor be baked too fast; if so, they will
be “mushy.”</p>

<p>They are most generally liked slightly juicy when served&mdash;not
too wet nor too dry, but just “juicy.” They may be served with
the Salad Entrée dressing, Improved Mayonnaise or French
dressing, with oil or lemon juice or with Chili sauce, but they
all spoil that delightful bean flavor in the rich, thick juice.
Beans have a characteristic flavor which is destroyed by the
addition of anything but salt and water. Molasses, cream, nut
butter and tomato are all good in their place, but that is not in
baked beans if we attain to the keenest enjoyment of the bean
flavor. We get the rich red color, without the rank molasses
taste, by prolonged baking. Cream and milk deaden the flavor,
and nut butter and tomato change it.</p>

<p>Those who taste our baked beans for the first time exclaim,
“I would not have believed it,” and it is hard for them to believe
that there is no meat in them.</p>

<p>Bake Red Kidney and other varieties of beans the same as
white beans.</p>

<p>For those who think they must have the molasses, use 1 teaspn.
molasses (or 2 teaspns. for a very strong molasses flavor) 2 teaspns.
oil and 1½&ndash;1¾ teaspn. salt to each pint of beans.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_192" class="pagenum" title="192"> </a>
★ Western Baked Beans</h4>

<p>Boil beans in salted water until the skins are broken. Put into
a pudding dish with plenty of water and bake in a slow oven
until dry and mealy and delicately browned over the top.</p>


<h4>Baked Split Yellow Peas</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. (1½ lb.) split peas</li>
  <li>1&ndash;2 tablespns. browned flour</li>
  <li>½ cup strained stewed tomato</li>
  <li>3&ndash;3½ teaspns. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Wash peas, put into bean pot, add browned flour, tomato
and salt which have been mixed together, then turn over them
two or three times their quantity of boiling water. Stir well.
When boiling, regulate the heat of the oven so as to keep them
gently simmering for from 5 to 7 hours. Do not stir after they
are first put to cooking. They require greater care than beans
to keep them from breaking. However, if they do not keep
their shape they will be of a jelly-like consistency not at all
objectionable. May add 2 large onions sliced fine.</p>


<h4>Baked Split Yellow Peas No.&nbsp;2</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. peas</li>
  <li>¼ cup roasted nut butter</li>
  <li>1 cup tomato</li>
  <li>3&ndash;3½ teaspns. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub nut butter smooth with tomato and add with salt and
boiling water to peas. Raw nut butter and browned flour may
be substituted for the roasted nut butter.</p>


<h4>★ Baked Split Green Peas</h4>

<p>Wash peas and put into a baking dish with 1 teaspn. of salt
to each pint of peas and 2 to 2½ times the quantity of water.
Cook on top of the stove until tender (about 1 hour), then put,
covered, into a slow oven and bake until dry and mealy all
through, which will not be long if there was not too much water
in them. Peas lose their delicate flavor and develop a strong
taste if cooked too long. If this amount of water is too great,
use a little less. Serve if desired in the dish in which they were
baked, with sauces given for mashed peas. A mint and celery
flavored raw nut butter sauce is nice with them.</p>

<p><a id="Page_193" class="pagenum" title="193"> </a>
When desired very smooth they may be put through a colander.
They may be used in soups and in all dishes where mashed
peas are required.</p>


<h4>Baked Lentils&mdash;great favorites</h4>

<p>Stew lentils with salt, with or without chopped onion, until
nearly tender.</p>

<p>Add a little cream, turn into a baking dish and finish in the
oven. Serve juicy.</p>

<p>A little thick cream poured over the lentils during the last of
the baking gives a nice crusty finish to the top.</p>


<h4>Stewed Beans</h4>

<p>Put red kidney and other beans with tough skins into boiling
unsalted water and cook until nearly but not quite tender before
adding the salt. Common white, Lima and all beans with tender
skins must be put into boiling salted water at first. After a
short time of rapid boiling let beans just simmer until tender,
then add a little heavy cream and stand back where they will
keep hot but will not boil, for a half hour or longer. A little
raw nut butter may be cooked with them sometimes, or, cocoanut
cream may be substituted for dairy cream.</p>

<p>Red kidney and some of the richer varieties may be served
with boiled rice or in a mashed potato border.</p>


<h4>Stewed Split Green Peas</h4>

<p>Cook peas in salted water ¾ to 1 hour, add cream, heat and
serve. Two parts stewed dried or green sweet corn to one of
peas, may be added sometimes.</p>


<h4>Flowering Beans</h4>

<p>which have no equal in flavor, should be put into a large
quantity of cold water, brought to the boiling point, boiled for
10 m., drained and put to cooking in boiling unsalted water.
Add salt when nearly tender. Try them.</p>


<h4>Stewed Beans in Bean Sauce</h4>

<p>Mash a few of the stewed beans, add cream, or milk and butter
<a id="Page_194" class="pagenum" title="194"> </a>
with the water from the beans, more salt if necessary; blend
well, pour over remainder of beans, heat. Serve on toast or as
preferred.</p>


<h4>Stewed Lentils&mdash;for people with good digestion</h4>

<p>Cook lentils with raw nut butter, onion, garlic, browned flour
and salt, until tender, rich and juicy. Serve without mashing
with boiled rice or with some of the large sizes of macaroni,
cooked.</p>

<p>Lentils may be cooked plain with salt and seasoned with cream
or butter at the last.</p>


<h4>Ragout of Chick Peas&mdash;especially delicious</h4>

<p>Soak the peas over night. Cook and cook and cook in the
water they were soaked in. When about half done add garlic,
onion, a very little browned flour, tomato and salt. Serve with
dressing, rice, dumplings&mdash;steamed or baked, or on toast.</p>


<h4>Cabbage Leaf Rolls of Lentils</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup lentils</li>
  <li>1 cup rice</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. raw nut butter</li>
  <li>onion</li>
  <li>sage</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>1 loose head of cabbage</li>
  <li>a little tomato if desired</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil cabbage leaves in salted water 5&ndash;8 m., or sprinkle with
salt, pour boiling water over and let stand 20 m. to ½ hour.
Refresh with cold water, drain.</p>

<p>Cook lentils till beginning to get tender but not until broken,
drain and save water.</p>

<p>Cook rice in salted water until swollen but not soft (about 15
m.), drain if necessary and save the water. Mix lentils, rice,
sage, chopped onion, raw nut butter and salt smooth with a little
of the lentil water. Put a tablespoonful of this mixture in
the center of each cabbage leaf. Fold the sides of the leaf over
and roll into croquette shape. Pack close in layers in an oiled
baking dish. (A flaring granite pan would do nicely.) Pour the
rice water and lentil water over, with a little tomato if desired,
<a id="Page_195" class="pagenum" title="195"> </a>
and add enough boiling, slightly salted water to cover. Press a
plate over the rolls, cover and bake ¾ to 1 hour in a moderate
oven.</p>

<p>Drain, save liquid, remove plate, invert dish on to chop tray,
leaving rolls in a mound. Thicken liquid slightly and turn over
rolls or serve separately. Garnish mound.</p>

<p>Dairy butter may be used in place of raw nut butter.</p>

<h4>Savory Hash</h4>

<p>Equal quantities mashed lentils and boiled rice or chopped
potato, seasoned with sage or onion. Add water or cream and
salt. A few soaked and chopped dried olives may be added to
the hash.</p>

<p>“The pea and the lentil are roasted in the Mediterranean countries
and form there a regular article of food. In India peas are
parched in hot sand. The chick-pea, as found by experiment,
can be parched over coals in a few moments and thus be made
edible. The taste reminds one of pop corn and roasted chestnuts.
A slight bitterness is present, due, probably, to the skin
which does not slip off in roasting as does the skin of the peanut.
When this skin is removed before roasting, as it may be
by a half hour’s soaking, the product is improved.</p>

<h3 id="EGGS">EGGS</h3>

<p>“Milk and eggs should not be classed with flesh meat. In
some cases the use of eggs is beneficial.”</p>

<p>“While their use will become more and more unsafe as disease
in animals increases, they should not be discarded entirely,
when other foods to supply the needed elements cannot be obtained.
<a id="Page_196" class="pagenum" title="196"> </a>
Great care, however, should be taken to obtain milk
from healthy cows and eggs from healthy fowls that are well fed
and well cared for.”</p>

<p>Though eggs are, to some extent, stimulating, they do not
contain the poisonous, excrementitious matter found in the flesh
of dead animals; and no animal life is destroyed by their use.</p>

<p>As eggs, at present, form so important a part of the Vegetarian
dietary, care should be taken to prepare them attractively
and palatably.</p>


<h4>Suggestions</h4>

<p>Only strictly fresh eggs should be used for any purpose. There
is danger in stale eggs.</p>

<p>The beaten raw egg is usually considered the most digestible,
but there are some with whom lightly cooked eggs, as “Eggs in
the Shell” agree best, and still others upon whom the soft yolk
acts almost like poison, who can take omelets or scrambled eggs
better, where the whites and yolks are thoroughly mingled
(when cooked in not too large a quantity of oil).</p>

<p>Occasionally we find a person with whom the white of the egg
disagrees; but very seldom.</p>

<p>Try taking the beaten white of an egg when you have a sour
stomach. It is very soothing, also, to an irritated, sensitive
stomach.</p>

<p>The white of an egg relieves the pain and prevents inflammation
when applied quickly to a burn or scald.</p>

<p>A few sliced Brazil nuts or filberts or broken pieces of other
nuts added to omelets or scrambled eggs aid mastication.</p>

<p>Salt should not be put into the water for poaching eggs; it
renders them less digestible.</p>

<p>The cooked yolk of the egg is most digestible when cooked
long enough to be dry and mealy, and the white when just jellied.</p>

<p>Never use milk in scrambled eggs or omelets. The casein of
the milk hardens with cooking and renders the eggs tough; besides,
the flavor of the eggs is much finer with water, and omelets
<a id="Page_197" class="pagenum" title="197"> </a>
are lighter. Cream spoils the flavor though it does not
toughen the egg as does milk.</p>

<p>Always bake soufflés, puff omelets, cakes, all things to be
made light with egg, slowly, and well from the bottom, so that
they will stay up, after rising. Serve soufflés and puff omelets
as soon as done.</p>

<p>For custards or any thickening, beat eggs just sufficiently to
mingle, not to a foam.</p>

<p>Drop yolks of eggs in cold water to keep them from drying up
when whites only are desired, and lift carefully from the water
with a teaspoon when ready to use.</p>

<p>Add a trifle of salt to whites of eggs before beating; they will
be lighter.</p>

<p>Stand yolks of eggs in half the shell on a wrinkled towel while
waiting to prepare the whites for egg creams and other dishes.</p>

<p>When eggs are used freely in breads, cakes or puddings, other
proteid foods will not be required, so they need not add to the
expense of the meal.</p>


<h4>Eggs In the Shell, or Curdled Eggs</h4>

<p>The objection to the “soft boiled” egg is that the white is
hard while the yolk is soft. To obviate this difficulty, put from
1 to 4 eggs into boiling water, 1 pint for each egg (cover if the
dish is broad and shallow; if deep, leave uncovered), and let
stand off from the fire for from 5 to 10 minutes according to the
age of the eggs. Fresh laid eggs will cook in a shorter time than
those several days old.</p>

<p>When a larger number of eggs is required, use a smaller proportion
of water and let them stand on the back of the range
where the water will be below the boiling point, for 5 minutes.</p>

<p>The most accurate way to obtain the desired result is to keep
the water at the temperature (by the thermometer) of 168 to 170
degs. for 10 minutes; never allowing it to go above 170 nor below
168. The flavor of eggs cooked in this way is as much more
delicate and delightful as is the consistency.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_198" class="pagenum" title="198"> </a>
Roasted Eggs</h4>

<p>Prick the shells of the eggs several times at the pointed end to
prevent their bursting during cooking, set them on the large end
in the hot sand or ashes under the camp fire, cover with leaves,
hot sand and embers and cook for 10 minutes. When opened
they will be smooth and of a velvety consistency. The same result
may be obtained by putting eggs in the hot ashes under the
grate of the kitchen range.</p>


<h4>Poached Eggs</h4>

<p>In an oiled, shallow pan have unsalted boiling water deep
enough to be at least ½ in. above the eggs. Slide the broken
eggs (only fresh laid eggs will poach nicely) into the perfectly
boiling water, singly, or all from one large dish. Set pan on asbestos
pad, cover and leave where the water will keep hot but will
not boil, until the eggs are jelly-like. Remove carefully from
the water with a small oiled skimmer and cut off the ragged
edges with a biscuit cutter. Nothing is more offensive to the
eye than a rough ragged poached egg.</p>

<p>Besides the usual toast, poached eggs may be served on cream
toast, round slices of broiled trumese, on hash or creamed vegetables,
or in shallow nests of boiled rice, mashed potato or
spinach. Do not forget the garnish, as there is no place where
a spray of parsley gives a better effect than on poached eggs.</p>

<p>Or, place oiled muffin rings in the pan of water and break an
egg into each ring; take up with griddle cake turner and remove
the ring.</p>

<p>The most nearly perfect of all, however, are eggs poached in
the Buffalo Steam Poacher after the following method:</p>

<p>Have the lower part of the poacher ⅔ full of <em>boiling</em> water;
set the <em>well oiled</em> poacher cups, each containing an egg, into
their places; cover, let stand over the hot fire just a moment to
allow the cover to become filled with steam, then set off from
the fire. Leave, covered tight, for 6 m., when you will have
eggs beautifully jellied all through, which (if the cups were oiled
<a id="Page_199" class="pagenum" title="199"> </a>
sufficiently will slide out on to whatever you wish to serve
them on.)<!--TN: added closing parenthesis--></p>

<p>Sometimes poach eggs in thin cream or in milk and butter, lay
on to slices of toast, halves of biscuit or large thin wafers, and
pour the cream around.</p>


<h4>Poached Yolks of Eggs</h4>

<p>Drop yolks, one at a time, into rapidly boiling water; keep
them rolling, by rapid boiling, for at least 10 m.; then stand
where they will boil more slowly till done, 20&ndash;25 m.</p>


<h4>Poached Whites of Eggs</h4>

<div class="subtitle">
To be cut in fancy shapes for garnishing.
</div>

<p>Break whites of eggs into thoroughly oiled cup or bowl, set in
pan of hot water, with something to keep the dish from touching
the bottom of the pan, and leave over the fire until the
white is set.</p>


<h4>Poached Beaten Eggs</h4>

<p>Beat eggs to a foam with water, or any desired addition, and
cook in steam poacher.</p>


<h4>Creamed Eggs</h4>

<p>Break eggs into a shallow baking dish, cover with thin cream
and bake in a moderate oven; sprinkle with salt and dot with parsley
leaves before serving. Or, bake or steam singly in ramekins
or custard cups. Rye bread crumbs may be sprinkled in the bottom
of the dish and over the eggs for variety, also ground pine nuts.</p>


<h4>Rice with Poached Eggs</h4>

<p>Steam rice in shallow dish; when done, make depressions for
the required number of eggs; break one into each hollow, set
dish in steamer for 2 m., or till whites are set, sprinkle with
chopped parsley and send to table. Creamed potatoes may be
substituted for rice sometimes, and either may be baked in the
oven by covering with a pan.</p>


<h4>Poached Eggs&mdash;Creamed Celery</h4>

<p>Put nicely poached eggs on rounds of toast and arrange in a
<a id="Page_200" class="pagenum" title="200"> </a>
circle on a chop tray; fill the center with celery in cream sauce.
Garnish with leaves of spinach.</p>


<h4>Hard Boiled Eggs</h4>

<p>Put eggs into warm water, bring to just below the boiling
point, 200 degs. and keep at that temperature for about 30 m.
Drop for a moment into cold water before removing the shells.
Or, when necessary, boil rapidly for 10&ndash;20 m.</p>

<p>Hard eggs agree with some stomachs better than soft ones.</p>


<h4>Italian Eggs</h4>

<p>Cut hard boiled eggs in halves lengthwise, lay on to cutlets
of corn meal porridge and pour Italian sauce around.</p>


<h4>Creamed Eggs on Toast</h4>

<p>Serve halves or quarters or slices of hard boiled eggs on toast
with cream sauce, plain, or flavored with celery or onion, with
chopped parsley sprinkled over. Plain or tomato drawn butter
may be substituted for cream sauce.</p>


<h4>Eggs and Macaroni</h4>

<p>Cook macaroni in 2-in. lengths, in salted water with onion
and garlic or garlic only. Drain and arrange in nest fashion on
chop tray. Lay whole, shelled eggs in center, pour cream of tomato
sauce around and over nest. Sprinkle with parsley.
Drawn butter or cream sauce may be used.</p>

<p>Or, cut eggs in halves, crosswise, remove yolks and mix to a
paste with melted butter, salt, onion juice and chopped parsley.
Fill whites with the mixture and arrange on bed of macaroni.
Pour sauce over. The roast gravy or some of the mushroom
sauces may be used.</p>


<h4>Eggs With Sauce</h4>

<p>Hard boiled eggs, whole or in halves, may be served with
cream, cream of tomato or mint sauce, or with sauce Imperial
or fruit sauces or jellies; with mint sauce on broiled nutmese.</p>


<h4>Stuffed Eggs</h4>

<p>Cut hard boiled eggs in halves, lengthwise, remove yolks and
<a id="Page_201" class="pagenum" title="201"> </a>
add to them bread or roll crumbs soaked in cream, a little
chopped parsley and salt. Rub all together until smooth, add
raw egg (or yolk only) to bind, fill spaces in the whites of eggs
and press the halves together. Add beaten whole egg to the
mixture remaining, dip eggs into it, roll in crumbs and heat in
oven or steamer, covered, until just warmed through. Serve
with any desired sauce.</p>

<p>A little onion juice may be added to the yolk mixture, or nutmese
or trumese cut very fine, with or without chopped mushrooms.
Mashed potato may be substituted for bread crumbs.</p>

<p>The eggs may be served as a garnish for green peas or on slices
of toast with or without sauce.</p>


<h4>Eggs with Ripe Olives</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>3 eggs</li>
  <li>12 (or more) olives, chopped coarse</li>
  <li>French dressing</li>
  <li>chopped parsley</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut eggs in halves crosswise, remove yolks and mix with olives
and dressing, return to the whites, stand on leaves of lettuce
and sprinkle with parsley. Pour dressing around. Improved
Mayonnaise dressing is suitable also. May garnish with whole
olives.</p>


<h4>Pickled Eggs</h4>

<p><i>Pickle</i>&mdash;2 parts each of lemon juice and water, ⅓ part sugar,
salt and a little celery salt. Heat to boiling, pour over hard
boiled eggs with a few slices of red beet. Let stand 24 hours.</p>


<h4>Eggs à la Salade</h4>

<p>Cut hard boiled eggs in halves lengthwise, remove yolks, rub
through wire strainer and mix to a smooth paste with Improved
Mayonnaise dressing (flavored with onion or garlic if desired),
fill the whites and press the halves together. Lay in nests of
shredded lettuce dotted with the dressing.</p>

<p>Or, rub whites through strainer, place around the inside of
nests of shredded lettuce; mix yolks with dressing, shape into
small eggs and place in nests.</p>


<h4>Shirred Eggs</h4>

<p>Butter and crumb individual dishes, break 1 or 2 eggs into
<a id="Page_202" class="pagenum" title="202"> </a>
each, set over pan of hot water in oven and bake until eggs are
set. The dish may be rubbed with a cut clove of garlic.</p>

<p>If preferred, sprinkle oiled griddle with crumbs, set buttered
muffin rings on it, pressing them down firmly, and drop an egg
into each ring. Bake. Sprinkle with chopped parsley, serve on
toast with any desired sauce.</p>


<h4>Scrambled Eggs.</h4>

<p>Put oil in pan and heat very hot but not smoking. Turn in
eggs which have been broken and salted but not beaten. As
they set, draw carefully from the bottom of the pan with a spoon
without turning over. When all are set but not hard, slide
quickly (leaving the shining side up) on to a plate or platter.
The dish must be all ready, as a moment’s delay will overcook
the eggs.</p>

<p><i>Another Way</i>&mdash;Take from 1 teaspn. to 1 tablespn. of water
(never milk) for each egg; beat, and scramble as above.</p>

<p>Do not stir, just draw the eggs from the bottom of the pan.
Cream may be used but the flavor is inferior to the water
scramble. Nut cream may be used instead of water.</p>


<h4>To Scramble a Large Quantity of Eggs</h4>

<p>Break 3 or 4 dozens of eggs into an oiled agate or aluminum
kettle, add salt and water, beat slightly and set kettle into hot
water. Stir occasionally at first, then more often as eggs begin
to set.</p>

<p>Do not try to keep warm long, but make fresh lots as required.</p>


<h4>★ Tomato Scrambled Eggs</h4>

<p>Take ¾&ndash;1 teaspn. thick tomato pulp to each egg, with salt.
May flavor with onion.</p>


<h4>★ Sour Milk Scrambled Eggs</h4>

<p>1 tablespn. thick sour milk to each egg, salt; cook till just done.</p>


<h4>Various Scrambles</h4>

<p>Simmer sliced celery or onion in oil a few minutes before adding
eggs. Or, add asparagus tips, green peas, mushrooms, a
<a id="Page_203" class="pagenum" title="203"> </a>
little boiled rice or a few broken nuts or bits of trumese or nutmese
to eggs before scrambling.</p>

<p>The yolks only may be scrambled.</p>


<h4>★ Cream Sauce Scramble</h4>

<p>Add 3 eggs to each half-cup of hot cream sauce; mix until
done. Garnish with sliced tomato. Mushrooms may be added
to the cream sauce before the eggs. Any desired sauce may be
used.</p>


<h4>Florentine Scrambled Eggs</h4>

<p>Spread nicely scrambled eggs on rounds of moistened toast
and place a broiled or baked half of tomato on top. Garnish
with parsley or spinach leaves or with lettuce and fringed celery.</p>


<h4>Egg Croquettes</h4>

<div class="title"><i>Sauce</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 tablespn. butter</li>
  <li>2&ndash;2⅔ tablespns. flour</li>
  <li>1 cup milk or thin cream</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. onion juice</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>6 hard boiled eggs, chopped</li>
</ul>

<p>The whites of eggs may be rubbed through a wire strainer or
a ricer. Make sauce the usual way; cool; add the eggs and shape
into croquettes, egg, crumb and bake. A few cooked chopped
fresh or dried mushrooms may be added with the eggs.</p>


<h4>Egg and Rice Croquettes</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 cups boiled rice</li>
  <li>¼ cup cream</li>
  <li>oil or melted butter</li>
  <li>3&ndash;4 hard boiled eggs, chopped or the whites riced</li>
  <li>grated onion or finely-sliced celery, or both</li>
  <li>chopped parsley</li>
</ul>

<p>Shape, heat in oven, serve with cream sauce, with or without
peas or celery.</p>


<h4>OMELETS</h4>

<p>The making of an omelet is very simple, requiring just a little
practice, and it is by far the most attractive way of serving eggs.</p>

<p>It is better to make several small omelets of 3 or 4 eggs each
than one very large one. Six eggs is the most that can be
handled at all properly.</p>

<p><a id="Page_204" class="pagenum" title="204"> </a>
Use 1 teaspn. to 1 tablespn. of water to each egg. The water
may be omitted entirely.</p>

<p>Eggs may be beaten a very little, or until light and foamy.</p>

<p>Omelet pans should not be used for anything else. To keep
them smooth, rub with soft pieces of paper or a cloth after
using, and occasionally scour them with salt. Do not wash them.
Keep in warm, dry place.</p>

<p>Omelets should be served immediately, when made.</p>


<h5>Plain French Omelet</h5>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>3 eggs</li>
  <li>1&ndash;3 tablespns. water</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat. Have butter or oil in pan to well cover the bottom.
Heat hot, but not to smoking or brownness. Turn the eggs in
and with a spatula (or a thin bladed knife) lift the set portions,
allowing the liquid part to run underneath. When all is set,
jelly-like, not hard, roll quickly from one side into the form, as
one writer says, of an “oval cushion.” Hold omelet for a
moment over the fire to take a delicate cream color underneath.
Turn on to a hot platter, the under side up, garnish and serve.</p>

<p>If an omelet is quite thick it may be folded over just double.</p>

<p>It should be a little soft on the top before folding.</p>

<p>The perfect shape is higher in the center and pointed at the
ends.</p>

<p>Olive oil, in the pan, gives a flavor much enjoyed by many.</p>

<p>If the oven is just right, setting the pan in the oven a moment
before or after folding puffs the omelet nicely.</p>

<p>The plain omelet may be varied by mixing some garnish with
the eggs and spreading it over the top before folding, or serving
it around the omelet on the platter.</p>

<p>When the material is to be folded in, leave the center of the
omelet a little thinner.</p>

<p>Accompaniments to omelets must be well seasoned and flavored.</p>

<p>Sweet omelets with fruits make nice desserts or luncheon
dishes.</p>

⅔ cup drained stewed okra, heat. Serve in and around 3-egg
omelet.</p>


<h5>Vegetable Pudding Omelet</h5>

<p>Put hot creamed vegetables&mdash;asparagus, peas, peas and carrot,
or any preferred, in bottom of pudding dish. Cover with omelet
mixture, bake in moderate oven till eggs are just creamy and
delicately browned; serve at once.</p>


<h5>Puff Omelet</h5>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. water</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix yolks, salt and water; beat the whites to a stiff froth with
a little salt, and chop into them the yolk mixture. Turn into a
hot well oiled pan and set on an asbestos pad back from the direct
heat of the fire. Cover and cook until the top will not
stick when lightly touched with the finger. It should take from
15 to 20 m. If cooked too rapidly the omelet will fall. Fold,
or slide on to a hot dish without folding. Serve plain or with
any desired accompaniment.</p>

<p>Sauces 16, 18, 44, 50 or 75 are all suitable for the puff omelet.</p>

<p>If the oven is not too hot, the omelet may be baked, but it
should be set on something to keep it from the bottom of the
oven and may need to have a pan turned over it. May score
across the top with a hot iron when omelet is not folded.</p>

<p>One egg only, makes a nice little omelet. It may be baked
in a large muffin ring (or two small) on a griddle and served on a
thin slice of toast, with or without cream sauce.</p>

<p>These omelets are delightful and one requires but little practice
to attain perfection in them. They will admit of the same
variations as the French omelet.</p>

<p><a id="Page_208" class="pagenum" title="208"> </a>
Fruit juices with a little sugar may be substituted for the
water sometimes. The water may be omitted.</p>

<h4>BREAD AND BAKED OMELETS</h4>

<p>Bread and baked omelets may be served with gravies, sweet
sauces or jelly, or with green peas or asparagus, or may have
corn, peas, etc., mixed with omelet before baking. They may
be made of milk, cream or water. Water makes the lightest
and most delicate omelets. Stale, not dry, crumbs are used.</p>


<h5>Baked Omelet</h5>

<ul class="ingredients">

<p><a id="Page_212" class="pagenum" title="212"> </a>
The timbales may be served on rounds of toast or of broiled
trumese or nutmese.</p>


<h4>Rice and Egg Timbales</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>4&ndash;6 hard boiled eggs</li>
  <li>2 cups boiled rice</li>
  <li>¼ cup oil</li>
  <li>½&ndash;1 cup finely-sliced celery</li>

<h4>Eggs in Perfection</h4>

<div class="subtitle">
For luncheon or for an invalid
</div>

<p>Poach yolk of egg and rub through coarse strainer; beat white
stiff with a trifle of salt and place in mound on a gilt edged plate
or small platter; dot with riced yolk, sprinkle with salt, press
slightly salted, green tinted, whipped cream through pastry tube
in small roses on to the top. Serve immediately with wafers or
long strips of zwieback.</p>

<p><a id="Page_213" class="pagenum" title="213"> </a>
This dish gives both the yolk and white in their most digestible
form. A little thick tomato pulp may be added to the white.
The cream may be dropped on with a teaspoon.</p>


<h4>UNCOOKED EGG DISHES</h4>

<p>Egg creams, in their great variety, are the most delightful
ways of serving uncooked eggs, both for desserts and for invalids.</p>

<p>For preparing them, the ingredients and all utensils and dishes
should be as nearly ice cold as possible.</p>

<p>The white of the egg should be beaten very stiff. The milk
and cream should have been sterilized.</p>

<p>The creams must be prepared just at the time of serving as
they become liquid and lose their creamy consistency very soon.</p>

<p>Set the glass or dish of cream on to a small plate with a doiley,
and if possible lay a delicate flower or leaf beside it.</p>

<p>The recipes are given for one egg but several may be prepared
at once, when required, by using a cake bowl for beating.</p>

<p>Lemon juice added to the white renders it stiffer, but other
juices and liquids soften it, so small quantities of them should be
used and they should be mixed in very lightly.</p>

<p>High colored fruits and juices should be poured between layers
of the egg, not mixed with it.</p>


<h5>Lemon Egg Cream</h5>

<p>Sprinkle a trifle of salt on to the white of an egg in a bowl
and beat with a revolving egg beater to a very stiff froth; then
add 1 tablespn. of sugar and beat until smooth and creamy.
Remove the egg beater, chop in lightly 2 teaspns. of lemon juice
and remove ⅓ of the beaten white to a cold plate. Add the
yolk and another teaspoon of lemon juice to the white remaining
in the bowl. Chop them in lightly and quickly, not mixing
very thoroughly. Drop this egg mixture into a cold glass and
on top of it lay the white which was taken out. Serve at once.</p>

<p>All of the white may be beaten with the yolk if preferred.
The whites of 2 eggs and yolk of one may be used.</p>

<p><a id="Page_214" class="pagenum" title="214"> </a>
A company of ladies to whom I once served this cream as a
dessert pronounced it “the most delicate boiled custard” they
had ever tasted.</p>


<h5>Raspberry Egg Cream</h5>

<p>Beat the white of 1 egg to a stiff froth with 1 teaspn. of sugar,
chop in the yolk with 1 tablespn. of cream, drop a spoonful or
two into a glass, then pour over a little rich red raspberry juice
or drop on a few crushed or stewed berries. Continue this until
all the egg is used. Serve at once.</p>

<p>A little lemon juice may be mixed with the raspberry if desired.
The cream may be omitted. A part of the white may
be left for the top. Strawberry, grape, currant and other juices
may be substituted for raspberry. Pineapple and orange juices
can be mixed with the egg: they are improved by combining with
lemon juice.</p>


<h5>Banana Egg Cream</h5>

<p>Combine 1 or 2 tablespns. of fresh banana pulp and 1 tablespn.
of cream with a beaten egg, leaving a part of the white on top
if desired.</p>


<h5>Vanilla Egg Cream</h5>

<p>Beat the white of an egg with 1&ndash;2 teaspns. of sugar, reserving
a little for the top; chop in the yolk with 1 tablespn. of cream
and a delicate flavoring of vanilla; serve in a glass, with white
on top of yolk mixture.</p>

<p>Or, for a change, beat the white and yolk separately, add half
the sugar and cream to each, flavor yolk with vanilla, pile white
in a dainty glass dish and pour yolk mixture over it. A little of
the white may be chopped with the yolk.</p>


<h5>Almond Egg Cream</h5>

<p>Use 1 teaspn. almond butter, mixed to a thick cream with
water, in place of dairy cream, in preceding recipe. Vanilla
may be omitted.</p>


<h5>Maple or Honey Egg Cream</h5>

<p>Beat the white of an egg, add ⅔&ndash;1 tablespn. of maple syrup
<a id="Page_215" class="pagenum" title="215"> </a>
or of honey (malt extract sometimes); chop in yolk and if desired,
1 tablespn. of cream.</p>


<h5>Caramel Egg</h5>

<p>Beat white of 1 egg, add 2 teaspns. of sugar, beat, chop in
yolk; pour over, stirring, the hot liquid made from boiling 1½&ndash;2
tablespns. of cereal coffee in ¾ cup of water to which 1 teaspn.
of melted cocoa butter has been added. Liquid may be added
cold, with a few drops of vanilla instead of cocoa butter.</p>


<h5>Egg and Milk</h5>

<p>Take 1&ndash;2 teaspns. of sugar and 3 tablespns. of milk, with the
beaten egg in vanilla cream.</p>


<h5>Egg and Hot Milk</h5>

<p>Beat whole egg with 1&ndash;2 teaspns. of sugar until creamy; add a
few drops of vanilla and pour over ½ cup boiling milk, stirring.</p>


<h5>Carbonated Egg</h5>

<p>Beat an egg, all together, with salt, add 1&ndash;3 tablespns. of
cream and as much carbonated water as desired.</p>

<p>Fruit juices may be used, with or without dairy or nut cream.</p>

<p>The carbonated water may be used with the beaten egg only.</p>

<h2 id="MUSHROOMS"><a id="Page_216" class="pagenum" title="216"> </a>
MUSHROOMS</h2>


<p>The delightful flavors of mushrooms make them a valuable
adjunct to the vegetarian dietary, whether or not they are
classed with meat foods.</p>

<p>No one need to be in ignorance as to the edible ones with the
many reliable books now published in regard to all varieties.
But if you have not studied the subject, consult some one who is
a judge before you use those you have gathered. Or, use only
canned ones or those sold in the markets. Many cases of sickness
have come from using mushrooms partially decayed, rather
than from poisonous varieties; so be sure to reject those not entirely
sound.</p>

<p>Mushrooms will not admit of many combinations without losing
character. The simplest ways of preparing them are the best.
It is a waste of time to peel any of the varieties except the
puff ball.</p>

<p>Puff ball mushrooms are all edible when gathered at the white
stage.</p>

<p>Overcooking toughens mushrooms. 5&ndash;20 minutes is sufficient
time for any, except, perhaps, when cooked in a double
boiler, then a half hour may not be too long.</p>

<p>Cream with water develops the flavors better than milk. Butter
when used gives the same result.</p>

<p>When necessary to wash mushrooms, rinse up and down in
cold water, rub the caps quickly, shake and drain in a colander.
Often they will require rubbing only, with a soft flannel. Always
cut off a thin slice from the end of the stalk and throw it
away.</p>

<p>When the caps only are to be used in a dish, chop the stems
and imperfect caps and cook for soups and sauces. Mushrooms
are not expensive, as a few fresh or dried ones go a long way for
flavoring. Unless plentiful, do not use mushrooms in timbales
<a id="Page_217" class="pagenum" title="217"> </a>
or roasts but in the sauces, where they will count. In the recipes,
fresh ones are meant unless canned ones are mentioned.</p>

</div>


<h3>Broiled Mushrooms</h3>

<p>Remove stems, place in fine wire broiler, turn the gills first to
the fire for 5 m., then the other side. Put a small piece of butter
in the center of each mushroom, sprinkle with salt, broil
5 m. Lay carefully on to pieces of toast or thin toasted wafers
or slices of broiled trumese, skin side up, and serve at once.
Melted butter may be poured over mushrooms on toast instead
of putting butter into them while broiling. Caps are sometimes
dipped in salt and olive oil and broiled after standing in a
cold place for an hour. The heat should not be too intense for
broiling.</p>


<h3>Baked Mushrooms</h3>

<p>Cut off part of stems, lay tops down in shallow baking pan,
dust with salt, put a small piece of butter in each mushroom,
bake 20 m. in hot oven. Serve in pan, or on toast with sauce
from pan poured over.</p>


<h3>Steamed Mushrooms</h3>

<p>Put mushrooms in saucepan or double boiler with salt and no
water. Cover close, cook 20&ndash;30 m. Add hot cream or butter
mixed with a little flour, heat. Serve on toast, cutlets of corn
meal porridge, rice cutlets or slices of broiled trumese. Butter,
2 tablespns. to the pound of mushrooms, may be added when
put to cooking and no milk or cream used.</p>


<h3>Stewed Mushrooms</h3>

<p>Cut mushrooms into sixths or eighths or slices. Cook in small
quantity of water 10&ndash;15 m., add cream, or milk and butter, enough
to moisten toast. Heat, serve on toast.</p>


<h3>★ Creamed Mushrooms</h3>

<p>Stew mushrooms in a larger quantity of water, add cream, and
thicken to the consistency of very heavy cream. Serve in dainty
<a id="Page_218" class="pagenum" title="218"> </a>
shells of pastry crust, or on toast or wafers, surrounded with
green peas or not.</p>

<p>A small quantity of mushrooms will go a long way in this way.</p>


<h3>Mushroom Stew</h3>

<p>Add cooked fresh or dried mushrooms to thickened consommé.
Serve over rice or macaroni or in rice border.</p>


<h3>Stewed Canned Mushrooms</h3>

<p>Drain mushrooms, if large cut into quarters and put into rich
egg or cream sauce without further cooking.</p>

<p>Canned mushrooms (except home canned) are esteemed more
for the feeling between the teeth than for their flavor and are
at their best in pies, scallops and creams.</p>


<h3>Dried Mushrooms</h3>

<p>Wash dried mushrooms well, soak 4&ndash;12 hours in water or milk,
simmer for 5 m. only, in the liquid in which they were soaked.
Use in soups, sauces or stews, in small quantities, as the flavor
is very rich.</p>


<h3>Pickled Mushrooms</h3>

<p>Soak mushrooms pickled in salt, for 24 hours, changing the
water several times; drain, and if to be cooked in batter dry between
the folds of a towel. Use cutlets of trumese batter with
them, or with soaked dried mushrooms.</p>


<h3>Puff Balls</h3>

<p>Pare and cut puff ball mushrooms into half-inch slices. Simmer
in butter or olive oil, with or without dipping in egg, and
season with salt. Or, stew and serve as other mushrooms.</p>


<h3>Mushrooms in Rice Rings</h3>

<p>Shape cups of steamed or boiled rice in muffin rings, fill with
creamed mushrooms or Boundary Castle sauce, protose and mushrooms
à la crême, thin, or with mushroom stew.</p>

crême <a href="#Page_115">p.&nbsp;115</a>, or all fresh mushrooms in trumese and mushrooms
à la crême <a href="#Page_165">p.&nbsp;165</a>.</p>


<h3>Fresh Mushrooms&mdash;Under Glass Globe with Cream</h3>

<p>Cover the bottom of a porcelain dish with toast. On the
toast pile mushrooms, gills down, several rows high, sprinkling
with salt. Pour ⅓&ndash;½ cup of cream on to the mushrooms, cover
with the globe or bell and simmer on the top of the stove 20&ndash;30 m.</p>

<p>The cover is removed after the plate is placed before the guest.
This quantity is served for luncheon when the dish is the principal
one of the meal. For a single course, a smaller portion of
toast would be required and not more than 4 or 5 mushroom caps.</p>

<p>The dishes may be baked in the oven.</p>


<h3>Mushroom Timbales</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup stewed mushrooms in pieces</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. butter</li>

</ul>

<p>Simmer onion in butter, add parsley, flour, and milk or consommé.
Remove from fire, add yolks of eggs beaten with the
tablespn. of milk, salt and mushrooms. Fill small molds which
have been garnished as desired, bake in pan of water 20 m. or
until set. Unmold on to rounds of toast, surround with thick
mushroom sauce.</p>

<p>The timbales may be made of canned mushrooms and served
with rich cream sauce.</p>


<h3>Mushroom and Oyster Plant Pie</h3>

<div class="title"><i>Sauce</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2½ tablespns. melted butter</li>

<p>Put cooked oyster plant and mushrooms in pieces (⅔ oyster
plant, ⅓ mushrooms), 1 pt. in all, into baking dish. Pour sauce
over, cover with universal or pastry crust and proceed as in trumese
pie.</p>

<p>Substitute stewed potatoes for oyster plant with either crust,
or cover with a thin crust of mashed lentils, or use celery in
place of oyster plant and cover with a rice crust.</p>


<h3>★ Cream of Fresh Mushroom Soup</h3>

<p>Cook chopped imperfect caps and stems of mushrooms in water
5&ndash;10 m. Add more water if necessary and heavy cream; thicken
with flour to the consistency of heavy cream. Add salt and a
few cooked caps if desired, or, from 1&ndash;3 caps may be placed in
each dish when the soup is served.</p>

<p>This soup cannot be improved upon.</p>


<h3>★ Boundary Castle Soup</h3>

<p>Add sufficient water with salt to Boundary Castle sauce to
make of the consistency of soup. Very delicious.</p>

<h2 id="STUFFINGS_AND_DRESSINGS"><a id="Page_221" class="pagenum" title="221"> </a>
STUFFINGS AND DRESSINGS</h2>


<p>The quantity of liquid, if any, must be determined by the purpose
the dressing is to be used for and the dryness of the ingredients.
As a rule, dressings are better without eggs.</p>

<p>Dressings may sometimes be put over the top of suitable meat
pies for the crust.</p>

<p>They may also be put into the bottom of a well oiled tin or
pudding dish with slices of or minced nut meat or mashed legumes
on top, baked and inverted on a platter or chop tray for
serving; garnished with halves of nut meats, accompanied of
course with a suitable gravy.</p>

<p>Whole pine nuts, or broken nuts of different kinds may sometimes
be used in stuffings.</p>


<h3>Simple Dressing</h3>

<p>Dip slices of stale bread into salted hot water quickly. Lay
them in a baking tin and sprinkle delicately with powdered leaf
sage or savory. When a sufficient number of layers is prepared,
sprinkle with crumbs and a little more water if necessary. Bake
in a quick oven about 20 m., or until browned over the top.
Serve on a platter with some ragout over it.</p>

<p>Or, bake in a pudding dish and send to the table to be served
with the meat dish with gravy.</p>


<h3>Savory Dressing</h3>

<p>Crumbs, egg or not, butter or oil, parsley, thyme, sage, summer
savory, onion juice and salt.</p>

MEAT AND VEGETABLE GRAVIES AND
SAUCES</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>“Perfection in the art of cookery is attainable only by lengthened
experience and careful study of the qualities of foods and the
application of sauces and seasonings. <em>It is chiefly in knowing how
to make and apply sauces that a cook shows her skill.</em>”</p>
<div class="attribution">&mdash;<i class="attribution">Old Writer.</i></div>
</blockquote>


<h3>Suggestions</h3>

<p>Use pastry flour for gravies and sauces.</p>

<p>The sauce should be a little more salt than the food with which
it is to be served.</p>

<p>As a rule, the sauce should be poured around, not over the
food.</p>

<p>No positive general rule can be given for thickening, as flour
varies and different kinds of liquid require different proportions.
Also the evaporation of liquids, in different quantities, varies.</p>

<p>About one tablespoon of flour may be calculated for each cup
of water; but for milk, cream or tomato that amount is quite too
much.</p>

<p>Do not make sauces too thick. A sauce should not be a paste.
The consistency of medium cream is about right for nearly all;
some should be thinner, and a few slightly thicker.</p>

<p>As they thicken by standing, make sauces thinner at first than
required.</p>

<p>A Roux is a mixture of oil or butter, and flour, heated together
for thickening sauces. It is used in the following manner;</p>

<p>Heat the oil, without browning, in a saucepan; add the flour,
rub smooth with wire batter whip, then add liquid, hot, stirring
until smooth. The sauce should come to the boiling point only
and be removed at once from the fire as otherwise the oil will
separate.</p>

<p><a id="Page_224" class="pagenum" title="224"> </a>
Adding flour to hot oil cooks it more perfectly than a boiling
liquid and obviates the raw flour taste.</p>

<p>Directions for flavoring, <a href="#Page_24">pp.&nbsp;24&ndash;27</a>.</p>


<h3 id="sauce_1">1 Plain Nut Sauce</h3>

<p>1 tablespn. raw nut butter, 1 pt. water. Mix butter with
water, boil ½ hr., add salt with water to make 1½&ndash;2 cups;
thicken slightly.</p>

<p>Serve with nut and legume dishes, over boiled rice and with
some vegetables. Steamed nut butter may be used instead of raw.</p>


<h3 id="sauce_2">2 Nut Onion Sauce</h3>

<p>Cook sliced onions with plain sauce.</p>


<h3 id="sauce_3">3 Nut and Tomato Sauce</h3>

<p>Use ⅓ tomato instead of all water in plain sauce. A little
browned flour sometimes.</p>


<h3 id="sauce_4">4 Nut Gravy for Roasts</h3>

<p>Cook browned flour, onion, garlic, bayleaf and a very little tomato
with plain sauce. A little sage occasionally.</p>


<h3 id="sauce_5">5 Nut and Tomato Bisque Sauce</h3>

<p>Thicken nut and tomato bisque, <a href="#Page_93">p.&nbsp;93</a>, slightly.</p>

<p>May use steamed or roasted nut butter, nutmese, or the water
from boiled peanuts with a little lemon juice, for nut sauces.</p>


<h3 id="sauce_6">6 Simple Brown Sauce</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 tablespns. oil or melted butter</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. flour</li>
  <li>1&ndash;2 teaspns. browned flour</li>
  <li>1 pt. water</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow directions for making sauce with roux.</p>


<h3 id="sauce_7">7 Brown Onion Sauce</h3>

<p>Simmer without browning sliced or chopped onion in oil, before

<h2 id="VEGETABLES"><a id="Page_237" class="pagenum" title="237"> </a>
VEGETABLES</h2>

<p>“Upon leaving Eden to gain his livelihood by tilling the
earth under the curse of sin, man received permission to eat also
‘the herb of the field.’”</p>

<p>While vegetables are not, as some suppose, the chief article
of a vegetarian diet, they form an important part of it, supplying
the bulk so necessary to good digestion, as well as the mineral
elements. One writer says, “Nearly all vegetables are blood
purifiers; they dissolve other food and greatly assist digestion.”</p>


<h3>Suggestions</h3>

<p>Vegetables should be used soon after gathering, as they begin
to ferment and lose their wholesomeness as well as flavors very
shortly.</p>

<p>As a rule put vegetables to cooking in boiling water, and bring
to the boiling point again as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Cook green vegetables in salted water to preserve their shape
and color. A lump of white sugar in the saucepan is said to preserve
the color also, or a few drops of lemon juice, or charcoal
tied in muslin.</p>

<p>Onions and cabbage should be cooked in salted water.</p>

<p>Cook roots and tubers in unsalted, and if possible soft water
until tender or nearly so; then add the salt and let them boil up
well.</p>

<p>If roots have become withered soak them in water as nearly
ice cold as possible, for three or four hours or over night, before
cooking.</p>

<p>Soak cauliflower and loose heads of cabbage in cold (not salted)
water for an hour or more. Drain and shake gently to dislodge
insects, if any.</p>

<p>Pare all vegetables except turnips, as thin as possible.</p>

<p><a id="Page_238" class="pagenum" title="238"> </a>
Turnips should be pared inside the dark line encircling them,
or they will have a strong taste.</p>

<p>Parboiling leeks, onions, cabbage and old carrots renders them
more digestible and more agreeable to some.</p>

<p>All vegetables will require longer cooking at great altitude.</p>

<p>Milk or cream of raw or steamed (not roasted) nut butter may
be substituted for dairy milk or cream with nearly all vegetables.</p>

<p>Many vegetables are delightful to the cultivated taste served
plain with Brazil or other nuts. Thus we get the benefit of the
fine delicate flavors in the different foods instead of covering
them up with sauces and dressings.</p>

<p>More elaborate dishes of vegetables are given among entrées.</p>


<h3>Artichokes&mdash;Globe</h3>

<p>Soak artichokes for several hours or over night, drain, cut
stalks close, trim away the bottom leaves, clip the sharp points
from the leaves or cut off the tops straight across. Boil in salted
water, if possible with charcoal tied in piece of muslin, until
tender enough for the leaves to draw out easily, ¾&ndash;1 hour. Remove
from water carefully with flat wire beater or small skimmer.
Drain upside down; serve whole or in halves or quarters, with
cream or egg cream sauce, drawn butter or sauce Amèricaine
poured around; or on a napkin on hot platter or chop tray and
pass sauce with them. Serve cold with French dressing.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to tie a strip of muslin around each artichoke
before boiling to hold it in shape, and to put an inverted plate
upon them while cooking to keep them down.</p>


<h3>Artichokes&mdash;Jerusalem</h3>

<p>Wash and boil artichokes with the skins on until tender,
30&ndash;40 m. If they boil too long they may become tough. Drain,
peel, and serve in rich cream sauce. They may be peeled before
boiling.</p>

<p>A still better way is to peel artichokes cut them into thick slices
and boil 15&ndash;20 m., then drain thoroughly and serve in cream,
cream of tomato or onion cream sauce.</p>

<p><a id="Page_239" class="pagenum" title="239"> </a>
Not containing any starch, Jerusalem artichokes are suitable
for salads, either cooked in slices and dried on a towel after
draining, or used raw in thin slices.</p>


<h3>Asparagus</h3>

<p>Select green asparagus for the table, the short bleached stalks
are tough and often bitter. Take care also that asparagus is
fresh. The tops of stale asparagus have the odor of spoiled
flesh meat and are not fit to use.</p>

<p>If not just from the garden, asparagus should stand in cold
water ½&ndash;1 hour before cooking. Wash thoroughly, dipping
the heads up and down in a large quantity of water, shaking
well to dislodge the sand.</p>

<p>As the different parts of the stalk vary in tenderness, the best
way to prepare and cook asparagus is to lay a handful of stalks
on a vegetable board and holding it with the left hand, with a
large sharp knife cut off the tips about 1½ in. from the end,
and if the next part is very tender, cut off 1 in. more to go with
the tips. Then cut inch lengths of the next that is of about
equal tenderness, and lastly, the remaining part of the stalk that
is not tough. The tough part save to flavor soups or sauces, or,
reject entirely.</p>

<p>To cook, throw the third lot, that nearest the tough part, into
boiling salted water, boil for 10 m., add the second lot, boil
10 m., throw in the top part and boil 10&ndash;15 m., or until tips are
just tender. By this method the asparagus is all nice and tender
and the tips are whole.</p>

<p>When desiring to serve in longer pieces, lay on the board as
before and cut 4 or 5 in. from the top (reserving the remaining
part for soups or scallops). Tie into neat bundles with strips of
muslin. Stand these bundles in rapidly boiling, salted water
with the heads well out. Cook from 20 to 30 m., when the
stalks will be tender and not decapitated.</p>

<p>Asparagus is one of the vegetables that will not admit of many
<a id="Page_240" class="pagenum" title="240"> </a>
combinations; such only as develop and preserve its characteristic
flavor are suitable.</p>


<h4>Asparagus&mdash;Cream or Butter</h4>

<p>Cook in short pieces as directed; drain or leave the water on
(there should be but little); add without stirring a little heavy
cream; bring just to the boiling point, remove from the fire, add
more salt if necessary, shaking gently to dissolve it, and serve in
vegetable dish with or without points of toast around the edge.</p>

<p>Butter may be substituted for cream.</p>


<h4>Asparagus&mdash;Egg Cream Sauce</h4>

<p>Lay cooked asparagus in small pieces on hot moistened toast
of any desired shape, on tray or platter, and pour egg cream
sauce, around. It may also be served the same with a nice rich
cream sauce, or with either sauce in pastry crusts for Asparagus
en Croustade.</p>


<h4>Asparagus&mdash;Drawn Butter</h4>

<p>On large, slightly moistened toast points on a platter, pile
long pieces of asparagus cooked according to directions (enough
for one serving on each piece of toast), the heads all one way,
and put a generous spoonful of drawn butter on each. Or the
sauce may be put on when serving.</p>


<h4>Asparagus&mdash;Sauce Amèricaine and Spinach Leaves</h4>

<p>Lay asparagus on hot platter with heads toward each end and
stem ends just meeting in center; surround with border of salad
leaves of spinach and place same across the asparagus where the
stems meet. Serve leaves with asparagus, and pass sauce<!--TN: as printed--> Amèricaine.</p>


<h3>String Beans&mdash;Cream, Nut or Dairy</h3>

<p>String beans should be gathered before the pods begin to show
the shape of the bean much.</p>

<p>To prepare, break the blossom end back and pull off the string
from that side, then break the stem the other way and remove
the string from that side. Wash beans well and if they have
<a id="Page_241" class="pagenum" title="241"> </a>
not been crisped before stringing, let them lie in cold (ice, if
possible) water a half hour or longer. Drain, take in handfuls
on to the vegetable board and cut into ¾ in. lengths (cut diagonally
instead of straight across when preferred). Throw
into boiling salted water and boil until tender, 1&ndash;3 hours. Drain,
saving the water for soups or to make drawn butter sometimes
for the beans. Cover with cream, heat, remove from fire, add
salt, serve.</p>

<p>Cream from raw nut butter may be added to the beans about
½ hour before they are done instead of using dairy cream.</p>

<p>Cream sauce of either nut or dairy milk may be served over
beans on toast if desired.</p>

<p>Wax and stringless beans are prepared and cooked the same
except that <em>young</em> stringless beans have no strings. Any of the
varieties may be cooked in whole pods when desired but will require
a longer time for cooking. Flowering or scarlet runner
beans are used for string beans when the pods are very young.</p>


<h3>String Beans&mdash;Nut and Tomato Bisque Sauce</h3>

<p>Prepare beans as above and cover with <a href="#sauce_5">sauce 5</a>, made of either
raw or roasted nut butter.</p>


<h3>Shelled Green Beans</h3>

<p>Wash beans before shelling and not after, cook in boiling salted
water until tender, the time varying according to the variety.
Allow plenty of time as beans are richer in flavor if simmered or
kept hot for some time after they are tender.</p>

<p>They may be served with different sauces, but it seems too bad
to spoil their delightful flavors with anything but salt, or a little
cream or butter, nut or dairy.</p>


<h3>Flowering Beans&mdash;Green</h3>

<p>The large pole beans with red and white blossoms have the
richest flavor of all shelled beans. After shelling, put beans into
cold water, let them heat slowly to the boiling point and boil
5&ndash;10 m. Drain, let cold water run over them in the colander.
<a id="Page_242" class="pagenum" title="242"> </a>
Return to the fire with boiling salted water and cook until tender,
considerably longer than other shelled beans. Serve plain,
or with a little cream poured over and shaken (not stirred) into
them a few minutes before removing from the fire. If one has
the time to hull these and Lima beans, it may be done.</p>

<p><i>To Hull</i>&mdash;Boil beans about half an hour (or until the skins are
loosened) in unsalted water. Drain and slip the hulls off with
the thumb and finger.</p>

<p>Cook after hulling in double boiler or very gently on back of
stove, adding seasoning before they are quite tender which will
be in a much shorter time than with the hulls on.</p>


<h3>Beets</h3>

<p>Beets should be fresh, plump and firm. If slightly withered,
they may be freshened by standing in cold water over night.
But if much withered do not waste time and fuel in trying to
cook them, as they will be bitter and tough with any amount of
cooking. Use care in handling beets before cooking so as not to
break the skins. If the skins are broken the flavor and sweetness
of the beet will be lost in the water. Press with thumb
and finger to find when they are tender rather than to puncture
with a knife or fork.</p>

<p>Put to cooking in perfectly boiling water. Boil steadily until
tender, when remove at once from the fire as over-cooking toughens
them, throw into cold water a moment and rub off the skins.
Serve plain, whole if small, or cut into quarters if large; or, slice
and pour over a hot mixture of lemon juice and sugar (part water
and a trifle of salt may be used), or hot cream with salt, or salt
and olive oil.</p>

<p>Small young beets, right from the garden, will cook in from
20 m. to 1 hr. Large, old ones in winter will require 3&ndash;5 hours.</p>


<h4>Pickled Beets</h4>

<p>Let sliced beets stand over night in <a href="#sauce_79">sauce 79</a>.</p>


<h3>Broccoli</h3>

<p>This is a vegetable grown in cool climates, similar to cauliflower,
<a id="Page_243" class="pagenum" title="243"> </a>
more hardy but not so fine in quality. Follow directions
for cooking and serving cauliflower, except that broccoli requires
about 20 m. only for cooking.</p>


<h3>Brussels Sprouts</h3>

<p>Wash, pick off outside leaves, lay in cold water ½&ndash;1 hour,
drain. Boil in salted water (in cheese cloth if convenient),
15&ndash;30 m.<!--TN: added period-->, according to age; do not cook until soft. Drain carefully,
pile in center of dish; serve with hot cream poured over,
or with <a href="#sauce_16">sauce 16</a>, <a href="#sauce_19">19</a>, <a href="#sauce_34">34</a>, <a href="#sauce_57">57</a>, olive oil or French dressing. May
add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice to each ½ cup of 34.</p>


<h3>Cabbage&mdash;Plain Boiled</h3>

<p>Trim cabbage and if not very crisp let stand in cold or ice
water 1 hr. or over night. Drain, cut into sixths, eighths or
any number of pieces 1&ndash;1½ in. across the broadest part. Lay
in sufficient boiling salted water to cover; let come to the boiling
point and set back on the stove where it will simmer gently ½&ndash;¾
of an hour, until tender only, and still perfectly white. Drain
and lay on to hot dish with pieces overlapping. Serve at once.</p>

<p>Until one has tried it, he will not know how delightfully sweet
this cabbage is, perfectly plain, eaten slowly with Brazil nuts, filberts,
almonds or English walnuts. It may be served with olive
oil or lemon juice, or with both together or with <a href="#sauce_16">sauce 16</a>, <a href="#sauce_34">34</a> or
<a href="#sauce_57">57</a>, or with the sour cream or sour milk salad dressing without
cooling. Use two eggs in dressing when serving warm.</p>

<p>If cooked until it begins to turn dark, cabbage will have a strong
flavor and will be indigestible.</p>

<p><i>To Parboil</i>&mdash;Put at first into a large quantity of unsalted boiling
water, cook 15 m., drain carefully, sprinkle with salt, pour boiling
water over and proceed as above.</p>


<h4>My Mother’s Cabbage, or Cabbage in Cream</h4>

<p>Shave crisp cabbage fine, cook in boiling salted water 20&ndash;30 m.,
until just tender and still white. Drain, pour in cream, heat to
almost boiling, serve.</p>

<p><a id="Page_244" class="pagenum" title="244"> </a>
<i>For Sour Cabbage</i>&mdash;Add a little lemon juice instead of or with
cream and more salt if necessary.</p>


<h4>★ Cabbage in Tomato</h4>

<p>Prepare cabbage as in preceding recipe, cook for 20 m., drain,
add stewed tomatoes (not too juicy, they may be strained if preferred)
with salt and cook until cabbage is tender. This is an
unusually fine combination and very suitable to accompany a
hearty nut meat dish such as broiled trumese. A little cream
may be added just before serving, but the dish is complete
without it.</p>


<h4>Cabbage and Corn</h4>

<p>Heat together 2 parts of stewed cabbage and 1 part of corn
with cream, nut or dairy.</p>


<h4>Sweet Sour Cabbage</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. fine shaved cabbage</li>
  <li>¾ cup water</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. oil or butter</li>
  <li>1 level teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. caraway seeds</li>
  <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook cabbage in water 15&ndash;20 m., then add the other ingredients
and simmer slowly until the cabbage is tender.</p>


<h4>Cabbage with Nuts and Raisins</h4>

<p>Season stewed cabbage with cream&mdash;cocoanut, almond or
dairy, or with butter; add stewed raisins and sprinkle chopped nuts
over just before serving. May garnish with halves of nuts.</p>


<h3>Carrots</h3>

<p>Carrots being among the most healthful vegetables should be
used freely, and with a little care they may be made exceedingly
palatable.</p>

<p>Unless very fresh, let carrots stand in cold water for some
time before paring. When they are full grown, or late in the
season, parboil them to remove the strong taste.</p>

<p>It will require from 20 m. to 1½ hr. to cook carrots tender,
according to the age and the sizes into which they are cut. A
<a id="Page_245" class="pagenum" title="245"> </a>
little chopped parsley makes a pretty combination with most of
the dishes.</p>


<h4>Carrots&mdash;Minced</h4>

<p>Scrape or pare carrots, cut into strips, grind in food cutter
coarse or fine as preferred, cook in water until tender, add salt,
boil, drain. Add a little cream, cream sauce, butter or oil,
reheat, serve. Add a trifle of sugar to cream sauce or cream.
Carrots may be ground or rubbed through colander after boiling.</p>


<h4>Carrots&mdash;Stewed</h4>

<p>Cut pared carrots into quarters, sixths or eighths, lengthwise,
then across in quarter inch slices in the largest part and gradually
thicker toward the small end; or if carrots are small and of
uniform size they may be cut in whole round slices. Cook until
tender, drain, and reheat with cream, or <a href="#sauce_16">sauce 16</a> or <a href="#sauce_28">28</a>, to each
pint of which a teaspoonful of sugar has been added, or add butter
and lemon juice, <a href="#sauce_1">sauce 1</a>, <a href="#sauce_2">2</a> or <a href="#sauce_34">34</a>.</p>


<h4>Carrots à la Washington</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. sliced or diced carrots</li>
  <li>1 cup to 1 pint sliced onions</li>
  <li>¼ cup strained tomato</li>
  <li>½ tablespn. browned flour</li>
  <li>¾&ndash;1 teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. raw nut butter if desired</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook all together in a small quantity of water until carrots
are tender and well dried out.</p>


<h4>Pickled Carrots</h4>

<p>Pour <a href="#sauce_79">sauce 79</a>, over sliced cooked carrots, cover and let stand
for several hours.</p>


<h4>Carrots and Peas&mdash;Better than either alone</h4>

<p>Mix 1 part stewed carrots and 2 parts cooked green peas. Add
cream or cream sauce, heat and serve.</p>

<p>Or, the carrots may be cooked in slices, laid overlapping
around edge of flat dish, with peas piled in center and sauce
poured around.</p>


<h4>Carrots and String Beans&mdash;Excellent</h4>

<p>Equal quantities cooked string beans and carrots with cream
<a id="Page_246" class="pagenum" title="246"> </a>
or cream sauce. If preferred, the beans may be cooked whole
and the carrots cut into strips.</p>


<h4>Carrots and Onions</h4>

<p>Pour hot cream over a mixture of stewed onions and carrots;
heat and serve.</p>


<h4>Carrots and Beets</h4>

<p>Heat mixture for pickled carrots, add 1 part carrots and 2
parts beets; serve as soon as hot. Butter, lemon juice and salt
may be used instead of the dressing.</p>


<h4>Carrots and Corn&mdash;Delightful</h4>

<p>To equal quantities of stewed carrots and corn add cream or
thin rich cream sauce; heat, serve. If the corn is dried corn,
especially dried yellow sweet corn, the dish is most delightful.</p>


<h4>Carrots and Succotash</h4>

<p>1 part each carrots and beans with 2 parts corn; season with
cream or with milk and butter.</p>


<h3>Cauliflower</h3>

<p>While cauliflower is a delightfully delicate vegetable when
properly cooked, it is easily rendered strong and disagreeable.
It should be cooked until tender only, 15&ndash;25 m. in constantly
boiling liquid, either slightly salted water, or milk and water (⅓
milk), salted. Tie loosely in cheese cloth or muslin to prevent
any particles of scum from settling on it and to keep the flowerets
whole, then drop into a sufficient quantity of rapidly boiling
liquid to cover it.</p>

<p>It should not lose its snowy whiteness in cooking. 5 m. of
over-cooking will ruin it. The milk helps to keep it white and
gives it a richer flavor.</p>

<p>To serve whole, trim off the outside leaves, leaving the inside
green leaves on, and cut the stalk close. When done, lay carefully
in a round dish and pour sauce over or around it. If the
head is a perfect one, do not cover its beauty with sauce.</p>

<p><a id="Page_247" class="pagenum" title="247"> </a>
<a href="#sauce_16">Sauce 16</a>, <a href="#sauce_18">18</a> or <a href="#sauce_75">75</a> or <a href="#sauce_34">34</a> plain or with lemon juice, are all
suitable for the heads, and when broken into flowerets it is delightful
with hot rich cream poured over it. Salt and oil, with
or without lemon juice may also be used.</p>

<p>Nice perfect flowerets with Sauce Amèricaine or any suitable
sauce may be used as a garnish for timbales and other true meat
dishes.</p>

<p>For salad, let cooked cauliflower stand in cold water until
ready to serve.</p>


<h3>Celery&mdash;Raw</h3>

<p>Trim off the coarse outside stalks, leaving about an inch of
the root stalk; then cut the whole stalk into quarters or sixths
from the bottom up, and throw into ice water until well crisped.
If there should be dirt between the stalks it will be necessary to
cut them off and brush each one separately with a vegetable
brush. Throw the tender inside stalks into water to be served
raw, and reserve the outside ones for cooking.</p>

<p>It is said that wilted celery may be restored to crispness by
dipping into hot water or laying a few minutes in warm water,
then plunging into ice water.</p>


<h4>Celery&mdash;Mint Sauce</h4>

<p>Cut tender stalks of celery across as fine as possible, cover
with cold fresh mint sauce and serve in dainty cups with suitable
true meat dishes.</p>


<h4>Celery&mdash;Stewed</h4>

<p>Cut tender stalks of celery (not those that are fit for flavoring
only) into half-inch lengths, by handfuls on board with large knife.
Put into boiling salted water and boil 30&ndash;35 m., or until just
tender. Drain (there should not be much water left), pour cream
or sauce over, let stand over hot water 10&ndash;20 m. Serve by itself
or on toast. <a href="#sauce_16">Sauce 16</a>, plain, with a few drops of lemon juice
in it, or made with half water in which the celery was cooked,
or <a href="#sauce_34">34</a>, <a href="#sauce_57">57</a> or <a href="#sauce_31">31</a> (when using 31, of course it should not stand
over hot water) are all enjoyable with it.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_248" class="pagenum" title="248"> </a>
★ Celery in Tomato</h4>

<p>Stew celery as above in just enough water to cook, for 25 m.
and have very little water, if any, remaining; then add enough
strained or unstrained stewed tomato to nearly cover, and simmer
until celery is tender and tomato cooked away a little. The
combination of the flavors of celery and tomato is unusually
fine. The addition just before serving of a little heavy cream
makes the dish still more delicious.</p>


<h3>Chard&mdash;Swiss</h3>

<p>Swiss Chard or Spinach Beet, affords two distinct dishes from
the same plant at one time. Strip the leafy part of the foliage
from the stalk and cook as greens. Cook and serve the stalks
the same as asparagus. The leaves and stalks may be cooked
together as greens.</p>

<p>Young shoots of poke or scoke are sometimes served as “French
Chard.”</p>


<h3>Corn&mdash;Green</h3>

<p>The earliest varieties of green corn are never very sweet. By
far the richest and sweetest are the yellow kinds, though the
dark purple or black almost equals them. There are also some
medium or later varieties of white corn that are excellent.</p>

<p>Corn is at its best the day it is gathered. When not perfectly
fresh, cook corn in almost any other way than on the cob.
Never cook it in salted water as salt hardens it. Corn requires
the least salt for seasoning of any vegetable.</p>


<h4>Corn&mdash;On the Cob</h4>

<p>Husk nice fresh corn and put it over the fire in cold water.
When just at the boiling point, but not boiling, remove from the
fire. Let it stand in the hot water where it will not boil until
ready to serve.</p>

<p>Serve in a dish on a napkin covered with another napkin, or
in a close covered dish, as a few moments’ exposure to the air
toughens it. In eating, score each row with one tine of the
fork so that the hulls will be left on the cob, unless you have a
corn slitter.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_249" class="pagenum" title="249"> </a>
Corn&mdash;Boiled</h4>

<p>Put husked corn into boiling water and boil rapidly for 5&ndash;15 m.,
usually about 10 m., as that which requires 12&ndash;15 m. cooking is
really too old to cook on the cob. Young, tender corn will cook
in 5 m. Long boiling destroys the sweetness of corn and renders
it tough.</p>


<h4>Corn&mdash;Steamed</h4>

<p>Wrap ears of corn in cheese cloth and steam for 15&ndash;20 m.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img-10.jpg" width="350" height="222" alt="" />
<div class="caption">CORN SLITTER&mdash;FOR INDIVIDUAL USE AT TABLE</div>
</div>

<p>Hold the ear of corn with one hand and draw the slitter with
slight pressure. Three or four strokes will slit every grain on
the cob. It does not remove the corn from the cob but cuts the
hull of every grain. The delicious corn is obtained with the
slightest pressure of the teeth, leaving the hulls on the cob.</p>

<p><i>To Prepare Corn for Muffins, Oysters, etc.</i>&mdash;Slit the grains as
described above, then, holding the slitter in the same position
but elevating the hand use the front of the slitter as a scoop and
push the corn into a dish.</p>


<h4>Corn&mdash;Baked, Boiled or Steamed in Husks</h4>

<p>Select nice tender ears of uniform size. Open the husks and
remove the silk, then tie the husks close in place. A few of
the heavy outside husks should be removed. Bake the ears in
a <em>hot</em> oven, separate from each other, 15&ndash;20 m., remove the
husks quickly and serve covered.</p>

<p><a id="Page_250" class="pagenum" title="250"> </a>
Or prepare in the same way and after tying, cut off the stalk
and point of the ear and boil rapidly for 10&ndash;12 m. or steam for
10&ndash;20 m. Serve in the husks on napkin. The husks give a
sweet flavor to the corn and help to keep it warm when they
are not removed before serving.</p>


<h4>Corn&mdash;Roasted&mdash;Best of All</h4>

<p>Place husked corn in wire broiler or large corn popper and hold
close to bed of hot coals, or lay on gridiron over the coals,
turning the ears as necessary. The ears may be laid on the
coals when more convenient and turned often, or they may be
roasted in a <em>very hot</em> oven.</p>


<h4>Corn&mdash;Stewed</h4>

<p>If corn is quite old, grate the outside of each ear on a coarse
grater and scrape out the remaining pulp with the back of a
knife. Cook carefully in oiled saucepan on ring or asbestos pad,
in a small quantity of water 8&ndash;12 m.; add sugar, to give the
sweetness of young corn, salt and a little cream, cream sauce or
butter. Heat, serve.</p>

<p>When corn is not too old, the nicest way to prepare it is to
draw a knife down each row of kernels, then with a large sharp
knife cut a thin shaving from each two rows and scrape the pulp
from the cob with the back of a knife. Cook the part cut off in
boiling water for 5 m., then add the pulp and cook carefully 5&ndash;8
m. longer. Season as for grated corn, omitting the sugar if corn
is sweet.</p>

<p><b>In Milk</b>&mdash;Cook either way in milk in double boiler 20&ndash;30 m.,
and season as desired.</p>


<h4>Corn&mdash;Baked</h4>

<p>Prepare corn in either of the ways given for stewed corn; add
salt, sugar if necessary, and enough rich milk to cover. Bake in
hot oven 15&ndash;20 m.</p>


<h4>Corn&mdash;Dried</h4>

<p>Cover dried corn ½ in. (or more) deep with warm water, let
<a id="Page_251" class="pagenum" title="251"> </a>
stand over night. In the morning set in warm place and shortly
before serving time increase the heat gradually until it is about
at the boiling point, but not boiling. Season with a little
cream, milk or butter, or with cream of raw or steamed nut butter
and salt; heat, serve.</p>

<p>Or, cover with warm water 1½&ndash;2 hours before meal time and
keep hot (covered) on the back of the stove. Just before serving,
season and heat just to boiling.</p>

<p>Or, best of all, cover quite deep with cold milk, let stand in
cold place over night, cook in double boiler 1 hr. or longer,
season, serve.</p>


<h3>Cucumbers</h3>

<p>The fruit of the cucumber vine “serves to introduce a large
quantity of water into the system and is a refreshing addition to
richer foods, especially in hot weather, when its crisp, cool succulence
is peculiarly acceptable.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">Church.</i></p>

<p>One unusually successful physician used to recommend cucumbers
because they were “so crisp and easily digested.”</p>

<p>Cucumbers should be gathered in the early morning, laid in
ice water for an hour or two, then kept in the ice box or on the
cellar bottom until serving time. Or, when they come from the
market, they should be put at once into ice water and kept in it
until thoroughly refreshed. Cucumbers are nearly always left
on the vines until they are too old. Many never know the
delightful flavor of cucumbers in which the seeds are just formed
but not developed.</p>


<h4>Cucumbers au Naturel</h4>

<p>Pare nice crisp cucumbers, cut in quarters lengthwise and serve
on a flat dish, to be eaten with or without salt the same as celery.
This is by far the most enjoyable way to serve cucumbers.</p>


<h4>Sliced Cucumbers</h4>

<p>Pare and slice cucumbers in not too thin slices. Pass lemon
juice, salt and oil with them. Some prefer them with salt and
oil only; others with lemon juice and salt.</p>

<p><a id="Page_252" class="pagenum" title="252"> </a>
If not thoroughly crisp, or if prepared some time before serving,
lay in ice water without salt. Salt wilts and toughens them.</p>


<h4>Stewed Cucumbers</h4>

<p>Pare cucumbers, cut into halves lengthwise, crosswise also if
long. If seeds are large, remove them, but younger fruit is
better.</p>

<p>Lay the pieces cut side down in perfectly boiling unsalted
water. When nearly tender 15&ndash;20 m., add a little salt to the
water and finish cooking. They should be just tender, not soft
when done. They will take about 20&ndash;25 m. cooking in all,
never over 30 m. Drain thoroughly. Serve with <a href="#sauce_75">sauce 75</a>, <a href="#sauce_34">34</a>,
<a href="#sauce_28">28</a> or <a href="#sauce_29">29</a> or with <a href="#sauce_16">16</a> made of cocoanut or dairy milk. On toast,
with egg cream sauce like asparagus, they are especially nice.
Sprinkle chopped parsley in the sauce.</p>


<h3>Egg Plant</h3>

<p>Egg plant belongs to the family of the deadly night-shade,
the same as the potato, tomato, peppers and tobacco, and contains
an irritating principle which should be removed by thorough
parboiling when used.</p>


<h4>Egg Plant in Batter</h4>

<p>Cut egg-plant into ½&ndash;¾ in. slices, put into a large quantity
of cold water, heat to boiling and boil 5 m.<!--TN: added period-->; drain, repeat the
process, add salt to the third water and boil until just tender;
drain thoroughly.</p>

<p>Drop spoonfuls of the following batter on well oiled griddle or
dripping pan, lay on slices of the egg plant and cover with the
batter. Brown delicately on both sides on the griddle or bake
in a quick oven to a delicate brown. Serve at once.</p>

<div class="title"><i>Batter</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 tablespns. oil or melted butter</li>
  <li>3 tablespns. flour</li>
  <li>1½ cup boiling water</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>⅓ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>5 tablespns. stale graham bread crumbs, or enough to make a batter of the right consistency</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat oil (without browning), add flour, stir smooth, add water,
<a id="Page_253" class="pagenum" title="253"> </a>
stirring; when smooth, remove from fire, add beaten eggs, salt
and crumbs.</p>


<h3>Greens</h3>

<p>One of the many advantages that the country dweller has
over those who live in the city is the great variety of “greens,”
as we call the edible weeds, nearly all of which are superior in
flavor to the much prized spinach.</p>

<p>There is <i>narrow or sour dock</i>, easily distinguished from the
broad-leaved (which is not edible) by its long, slender leaf curled
on the edges; the <i>dandelion</i>, which should be gathered before
the buds appear or at least when they are just peeping out, as
the greens are bitter when the buds are well developed; <i>milkweed</i>,
of which we use only the tips unless the stalks are small
and tender: <i>pigweed</i>, <i>red root</i>, <i>lamb’s quarters</i>, <i>purslane</i> or
“pusley,” with <i>poke shoots</i>, the garden <i>turnip tops</i>, <i>cabbage
sprouts</i>,<!--TN: added comma--> young <i>beet tops</i> and <i>endive</i>.</p>

<p>Some are better in combinations, such as milkweed and narrow
dock, narrow dock and pigweed, milkweed and purslane and
purslane and beet tops.</p>

<p>Do not try to wash greens in a small quantity of water. Put
them when first gathered into a large vessel, a wash boiler, a
tub or a deep sink in which the water will be deep enough to
“swash” them up and down with the hands. When they are
thoroughly revived <em>lift</em> them from the water (do not drain the
water off), empty the vessel, rinse it well and take another
quantity of water. Continue the washing, changing the water
until no sand is found in the bottom of the vessel.</p>

<p>Dandelion and some other greens require trimming and looking
over carefully after reviving before the final washing.</p>

<p>When ready to cook, throw greens into an abundance of boiling
salted water and cook until tender.</p>

<p>The time required for cooking varies; narrow dock requires 20
m., purslane a little longer, pigweed 40 m., milkweed 2&ndash;3 hours,
beet greens 2½&ndash;3 hours, and dandelions 3½&ndash;4 hours. It is a
good plan to parboil dandelions.</p>

<p><a id="Page_254" class="pagenum" title="254"> </a>
When greens are perfectly tender, lift them carefully with a
skimmer from the water into a colander and press with a plate
until as dry as possible.</p>

<p>The water from all greens (except dandelion if at all bitter
and too large a quantity of narrow dock) is invaluable for soup
stock, so pour it off carefully from the sand that may be in the
bottom of the kettle even after the most careful washing.</p>

<p>When the leaves are long and stringy it is well to cut across
the mass of greens a few times before serving, but the flavor
and character are much impaired by too fine chopping.</p>

<p>Pass oil, lemon juice or quarters of lemon, French or Improved
Mayonnaise dressing, or Sauce Amèricaine with greens.</p>

<p><b>Poke Shoots</b>&mdash;scoke&mdash;pigeon berry weed, and young, tender
milkweed stalks may be prepared and served the same as asparagus.
Do not use poke shoots after the leaves begin to unfold.</p>

<p>Canned greens make as valuable an addition to the winter
supplies as canned corn or peas.</p>

<p><b>Kale</b>&mdash;borecole, should not be used until after heavy frosts in
the fall. Cook as other greens in boiling salted water 30&ndash;45 m.
and serve the same. If desired, raw nut butter may be added
to the water in which it is cooked; then lemon juice only will be
required with it. It may also be cooked with tomato, the same
as cabbage, by being chopped or cut fine before cooking. Onion
and raw nut butter may be added to the tomato.</p>


<h3>Okra&mdash;Stewed Whole</h3>

<p>Use only young, tender pods, cut off the stems, wash well and
cook in a small quantity of salted water (about 1 cup to each
quart of okra) for 30 m. or until tender. Season with cream,
dairy or almond, or with butter. Or, drain if any water remains,
and pour over it a hot French dressing. Melted butter may be
used in the dressing instead of oil.</p>

<p>Never cook okra in an iron vessel.</p>


<h4>Okra&mdash;Sliced, Stewed</h4>

<p>Slice pods of okra across and cook with 1 cup of salted water
<a id="Page_255" class="pagenum" title="255"> </a>
to each pint of okra until tender, 25&ndash;30 m. Drain or not, according
to what is to be added. Stewed tomatoes, strained or unstrained,
almond or dairy cream, <a href="#sauce_16">sauce 16</a>, <a href="#sauce_18">18</a>, <a href="#sauce_19">19</a>, or <a href="#sauce_34">34</a>, or hot
French dressing may be poured over it. When strained tomatoes
are used, the okra and tomato should simmer together about
10 m. Add a little heavy cream, butter or oil and salt just before
serving.</p>


<h3>Onions&mdash;Boiled</h3>

<p>Select onions of about equal size. Peel them, then at the
root end cut into the onion about ⅓ of the way at right angles.
This causes the onion to cook tender at the heart. Let stand
in cold water 20 m. to 1 hour. Put into boiling salted water
and cook until tender, ¾&ndash;1½ hour. The water may be changed
after 15 m. boiling. Drain, add cream, cream sauce or butter,
heat a moment (do not boil with cream), serve. Some prefer
onions plain with a little of the liquid in which they were boiled.</p>

<p>Drain young onions slightly when about half done, pour on
milk and simmer until tender.</p>


<h4>Onions&mdash;Stewed</h4>

<p>Cut peeled onions into halves, then into quarters, and slice
across in thin slices. Put into just enough boiling salted water
to cook tender; dry out well and serve plain or add a little oil or
melted butter, hot cream or cream sauce. Serve sometimes
over plain boiled or mashed potatoes. Raw or steamed nut butter
may be cooked with the onions.</p>


<h4>Onions&mdash;Baked</h4>

<p>Select large, perfect onions; peel, and boil until about half
done; drain, put into a baking pan, sprinkle with salt and crumbs,
pour a little oil or melted butter over and bake, covered part of
the time, until tender.</p>

<p>Onions may be dried after boiling, wrapped in oiled paper,
baked and served with melted butter or cream sauce.</p>


<h4>Onions&mdash;Raw</h4>

<p>Slice onions and let them lie in cold water (no salt) for an
<a id="Page_256" class="pagenum" title="256"> </a>
hour or more, changing the water occasionally. Drain, dry and
serve with salt, salt and oil or lemon juice or with French dressing.
If in a hurry to use them, dip sliced onions quickly into
boiling water, then into cold water and serve as before. Sprigs
of parsley are sometimes passed after dishes containing onions
to destroy the odor in the breath.</p>


<h3>Oyster Plant</h3>

<p>Oyster plant&mdash;vegetable oyster&mdash;salsify, is one of the most delightful
vegetables. It should not be used until after heavy frosts
and is at its best in the spring after being in the ground all winter.
Whatever is dug more than is to be used each time, should
be kept in sand in a cool place.</p>

<p>To prepare for cooking, soak in cold water 3 or 4 hours, or
over night. Scrape on a vegetable board with a knife and drop
each root into a large quantity of cold water as soon as scraped
to keep it from turning dark.</p>

<p>When very fresh, oyster plant will cook in 10 m., but late in
the season it often requires a half hour. Cook until tender
only, not soft.</p>

<p>The flavor of the oyster plant is in the water, so there should
always be some liquid left to form part of the sauce.</p>

<p>A little cream is required to develop the flavor of oyster plant.</p>

<p>Water and cream are better than milk.</p>

<p>Milk and a little butter may be used when cream is not obtainable.
Raw or steamed nut butter may be used in place of
either, and olive oil instead of butter gives an appropriate flavor.</p>

<p>If there should be dark spots through the oyster plant, be
sure that every particle is removed, as one little piece with a
dark spot in it will flavor the whole dish.</p>

<p>The carbohydrates of oyster plant do not include starch.</p>


<h4>Stewed or Creamed Oyster Plant</h4>

<p>Cut scraped roots into slices ¼&ndash;⅓ in. thick according to size,
and drop into the water in which they are to be cooked, an equal
<a id="Page_257" class="pagenum" title="257"> </a>
quantity, usually. Boil without salt for 10&ndash;25 m. When nearly
tender, add salt.</p>

<p>To the oyster plant liquor, add a little heavy cream, and when
boiling, add flour blended with water to make of a creamy consistency;
salt if necessary. Chopped parsley may sometimes be
added, and a little celery salt occasionally, but oyster plant will
not admit of the addition of many flavors. If to be served on
toast or rice, or in a rice border, a little onion juice may be added.</p>


<h4>Oyster Plant with Drawn Butter Sauce</h4>

<p>Cook oyster plant in 2-in. lengths in a small quantity of water.
Add <a href="#sauce_40">sauce 40</a>, heat, serve on toast or rice.</p>


<h4>Oyster Plant with Celery or Corn</h4>

<p>Use ⅓ or ½ cooked celery or corn in recipe for stewed oyster
plant.</p>

<p>Any of these dishes may be served as a second course at dinner
with beaten biscuit with or without ripe olives.</p>


<h3>Parsley</h3>

<p>When parsley is fresh, wash, shake and keep in a thick paper
sack near the ice. When withered, put at once into ice water
until refreshed.</p>

<p>To dry, pick off the leaves and stand in a warm place. It is
better than not any when fresh is not obtainable.</p>


<h3>Parsnips</h3>

<p>The parsnip is another vegetable not good until after heavy
frosts, and is much sweeter and richer in flavor when left in the
ground until spring.</p>


<h4>Boiled Parsnips</h4>

<p>Scrape or pare parsnips, cut into halves or thirds in flat slices
lengthwise; cook in boiling salted water until just tender, 20 m.
to 1 hour according to age and size. Serve plain or with hot
cream or butter poured over.</p>

<p>Parsnips may be steamed instead of boiled.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_258" class="pagenum" title="258"> </a>
Stewed Parsnips</h4>

<p>Cut parsnips into slices crosswise, ½&ndash;¾ in. thick, or if large,
cut into quarters first, then slice. Cook in small quantity of
water until just tender. Serve with cream, cream sauce, or egg
cream or drawn butter sauce.</p>


<h4>Browned Parsnips</h4>

<p>Lay slices of boiled or steamed parsnips in baking pan, pour
over a little cream, oil or melted butter and sprinkle with sugar.
Brown delicately in oven. Or, dip in oil or butter and flour and
brown in quick oven.</p>


<h4>Mashed Parsnips</h4>

<p>Rub parsnips through the colander; season with salt only, or
with salt and cream. Heat and serve.</p>


<h4>Fricassee of Parsnips</h4>

<p>Boil sliced parsnips in milk without salt. When tender add
salt and thicken slightly with flour stirred smooth with milk.
Serve on toast.</p>


<h3>Peas</h3>

<p>Green peas should be neither too old nor too young. When
they are small and soft they have no character, but if too old they
are hard and flavorless. To be at their best they should be
cooked the day they are gathered.</p>


<h4>Green Peas&mdash;Stewed</h4>

<p>For fresh tender green peas, wash the pods, shell and put at
once into boiling salted water. Washing after shelling takes
away much of the sweetness. Cook until tender, 15&ndash;25 m. There
should be very little water left when they are done. When
nice and sweet they require no seasoning but salt. Serve plain,
with just enough of the water in which they were cooked to
moisten them. A little sweet cream, butter or cream sauce may
be added.</p>

<p>Peas that have become withered should be shelled and allowed
to stand in cold water for an hour before cooking.</p>

<p>When peas are a little old they require longer cooking, and
<a id="Page_259" class="pagenum" title="259"> </a>
should have a little sugar in the water in which they are cooked.
A small sprig of mint improves the flavor of old peas, but the
positive mint flavor should not be distinguishable.</p>

<p>Canned peas of an inferior quality drained and boiled in fresh
water with sugar and mint are sometimes hardly distinguishable
from fresh peas. A sprig of parsley may be stewed with peas
instead of mint.</p>


<h4>Peas&mdash;Parisian Style</h4>

<p>Cook in boiling, salted water with parsley and onion; add
sugar, and thicken the liquid a trifle.</p>


<h4>Peas&mdash;German Way</h4>

<p>Put a spoonful of butter in the saucepan, add peas, salt and a
spoonful or two of water, cover close and cook until tender,
about half an hour, perhaps.</p>


<h4>Peas With Corn</h4>

<p>Combine green peas and corn as beans and corn in succotash.</p>


<h4>Peas With New Potatoes</h4>

<p>Cook peas and small new potatoes together. Cover with cream
or thin cream sauce.</p>


<h4>Melting Sugar Peas</h4>

<p>This is the name of one variety of the edible podded peas.
They have a delightful flavor peculiar to themselves. Wash and
drain the pods and cut like string beans. Cook in a small quantity
of boiling salted water until tender, about 30 m. Add cream,
cream sauce or a little butter. Heat and serve.</p>


<h3>Potatoes</h3>

<p>There is great diversity of opinion in regard to the value of
the potato as a food. Some, because of its belonging to the
family of the deadly night shade, the same family as tobacco,
think it should be used sparingly if at all, while others consider
it (when baked, at least) one of the most wholesome foods. Its
use is often prohibited by physicians in some forms of indigestion
and for those rheumatically inclined.</p>

<p><a id="Page_260" class="pagenum" title="260"> </a>
The solid part of the potato is almost entirely starch, so it
serves as bulk in combination with nitrogenous foods.</p>

<p>“Potatoes which have grown on the surface of the ground or
which have been exposed to the light frequently turn green, and
such tubers contain abnormal amounts of solanin, as do old and
shriveled potatoes which have sprouted. It is best not to use
such old potatoes, but if they are eaten the flesh around the
sprouts should be cut away, as this portion is particularly liable
to contain solanin.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">C.&nbsp;F. Langworthy, Ph.&nbsp;D. Farmers’ Bulletin,
295. U.&nbsp;S. Dept. of Agriculture.</i></p>

<p>Solinine is a vegetable alkaloid which may produce serious results
as it is of about the same nature as belladonna and other
poisons of that class.</p>

<p>Soak new potatoes for a short time only in cold water before
cooking, but old ones for at least 2&ndash;3 hours.</p>

<p>In paring potatoes, put them into cold water so that the dirt
will not adhere to the flesh. Pare not too thick and throw at
once into clear cold water.</p>

<p>When salt is sprinkled over potatoes after cooking it absorbs
the moisture and renders them more mealy.</p>


<h4>Baked Potatoes</h4>

<p>No other way of preparing the potato renders it so mealy and
digestible as proper baking. Wash and scrub the potatoes
thoroughly without breaking the skins, lay them on the grate of
a moderately hot oven without touching each other, so that there
will be a free circulation of heat around each potato. When the
oven is too hot, potatoes will be soggy and indigestible. Bake
until just done; do not try with a fork but by pressing with the
thumb and finger. When done, serve <em>at once</em> in an uncovered
dish, or lay a napkin in a deep dish and fold over the potatoes.</p>

<p>The most perfect way to serve a baked potato is to work it between
the folds of a towel in the hand without breaking the skin
until soft and mealy all through. Lay each potato on the grate
again until all are done. Potatoes may be broken apart in the center
<a id="Page_261" class="pagenum" title="261"> </a>
and a sprig of parsley laid in when serving on an invalid’s tray
or to individuals, but all must be done quickly, as a few moments’
delay after the potato is done will spoil its lightness.</p>

<p>If for any reason baked potatoes must be kept waiting, wrap
them in a thick towel and lay in a warm place.</p>

<p>When in a hurry for baked potatoes, pour boiling water over them
just before laying them in the oven.</p>

<p>Some think potatoes are whiter and more mealy if boiled until
nearly done and then finished in the oven.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most perfect way of baking potatoes is to lay them
on a wire stand in a close covered kettle without any water,
over a moderate fire.</p>


<h4>Boiled Early Potatoes</h4>

<p>Put pared potatoes into rapidly boiling, salted water. Do
not allow water to stop boiling. When nearly done add ½&ndash;1
cup cold water. Drain as soon as done. Shake and dry uncovered,
over fire. Serve in napkin. When obliged to stand
for a few minutes, throw a clean towel over the uncovered kettle
to absorb the steam.</p>


<h4>Boiled Late or Winter Potatoes</h4>

<p>Put potatoes into cold, slightly salted water. Bring to the boiling
point as quickly as possible. When half done, drain, add cold
water and boil again. Drain as soon as done, sprinkle with salt,
shake over fire until dry. Serve in napkin or uncovered dish.</p>


<h4>The Irish Way</h4>

<p>Put potatoes in slightly salted cold water; when the water boils
add a small quantity of cold water; repeat this process 2 or 3
times; when done, drain, shake until dry and send a few at a
time to the table.</p>


<h4>Potatoes in Jackets</h4>

<p>Wash thoroughly, peel off a narrow strip around the potatoes
the long way. When tender, drain, sprinkle with salt, shake,
peel and serve, or serve without peeling. Taking off the strip
<a id="Page_262" class="pagenum" title="262"> </a>
around the potatoes causes them to burst and become mealy, and
makes them easier to peel while still giving the flavor so much
liked by many.</p>


<h4>Steamed Potatoes</h4>

<p>Cook, without paring or with a narrow strip only taken off,
in steamer over hot water with a few sprigs of fresh mint. Dry
in the oven.</p>

<p>Allow at least 10 m. more for steaming potatoes, either with
or without their “coats,” than for boiling.</p>


<h4>Small New Potatoes</h4>

<p>Wash small new potatoes, boil or steam, sprinkle with salt,
shake over fire until skins begin to crack, serve in napkin.</p>

<p>Or, rub the skins off with a coarse towel (coarse salt in the
towel helps) or scrape the potatoes. After cooking and draining,
crack each by pressing lightly with the back of a spoon.
Lay in dish, pour hot cream or milk and butter over and sprinkle
with chopped parsley.</p>


<h4>Creamed Stewed Potatoes</h4>

<p>Cut potatoes into small pieces or slice not too thin; cook until
almost tender; drain, put into cream sauce in double boiler and
cook ½ hour longer. Whole small potatoes or large ones in
quarters cooked until tender may be served in cream sauce the
same.</p>


<h4>Creamed Warmed-Over Potatoes</h4>

<p>Cold baked potatoes are much the best for warming over.
Slice baked or boiled potatoes or cut into small pieces and put
into cream sauce, with or without celery salt or stalk or a little
chopped onion, and simmer slowly 15 m. Sprinkle with parsley in
serving.</p>

<p>Or, pour milk over potatoes, cover and heat slowly 15&ndash;20 m.
If raw nut milk is used heat a half hour. A little onion may be
added if desired.</p>


<h4>Water Creamed Potatoes</h4>

<p>Thicken boiling water slightly with flour, add salt, onion or
celery if desired, and sliced potatoes. Simmer 15&ndash;20 m.</p>

<p><a id="Page_263" class="pagenum" title="263"> </a>
Or, put a little oil or butter into the saucepan, add flour, then
boiling water and potatoes.</p>


<h4>Hashed Creamed Potatoes</h4>

<p>Chop cold potatoes, mix with cream sauce, put into baking
dish, sprinkle with crumbs and brown in oven.</p>


<h4>Hashed Browned Potatoes</h4>

<p>Mix cream, oil or melted butter and salt with chopped potatoes.
Spread evenly in well oiled frying pan, pour a very little water
over if oil or butter are used, cover and heat slowly without
stirring. When delicately browned on the bottom, fold or roll
like an omelet and serve on a hot platter with celery tops or a
sprig of parsley.</p>

<p>Or, pour brown sauce over potatoes in baking dish, sprinkle
with oil and heat in oven. A little milk or consommé may be
added.</p>


<h4>Improved Parisian Potatoes</h4>

<p>Cut balls out of large pared potatoes with vegetable scoop.
Cook in boiling salted water until just or hardly tender. Drain,
roll and shake in thin drawn butter or cream sauce, sprinkle
with parsley, serve as border of timbales or as garnish for other
meat dishes.</p>


<h4>Mashed Potatoes</h4>

<p>Very large, or irregularly shaped potatoes may be used for
mashing. Have kettle, fine colander and masher hot, with hot
milk or cream in the bottom of the kettle. Rub nicely boiled
potatoes, a few at a time, through the colander into the kettle
<em>as soon as done</em>. Beat very thoroughly until smooth and creamy.
Add more hot milk if necessary but do not make too soft or the
flavor of the potato will be lost. Mashed potatoes should be
served at once, but if obliged to stand, make them a little softer,
keep hot in double boiler and beat occasionally to restore the
smoothness.</p>


<h4>Potato Cakes</h4>

<p>Shape cold mashed potato into cakes, brown on both sides on
<a id="Page_264" class="pagenum" title="264"> </a>
oiled griddle, or brush with cream, oil or melted butter and
brown in oven. Serve as soon as done. When egg is added to
potato cakes, they fall soon after removing from the fire and
become solid and soggy; also the characteristic flavor of the
potato is to some extent destroyed.</p>


<h4>Browned Mashed Potato Slices</h4>

<p>Cut mashed potato (which has been molded in a brick shaped
or small round tin dipped in cold water) into rather thick slices.
Dip in beaten egg, then in crumbs, and brown in quick oven.
Serve with or without sauce. Slices may be served with a
poached egg on each.</p>


<h4>Potato Purée</h4>

<p>Add rich milk to mashed potatoes to make like thick porridge,
spread on hot platter as a foundation for cutlets, croquettes,
slices of broiled nut meat or nicely poached eggs. Garnish with
parsley or other green.</p>


<h3>Baked Sweet Potatoes</h3>

<p>Wash large sweet potatoes without breaking the skins, bake
in a moderate oven until they will yield to pressure between the
thumb and finger.</p>

<p>Or, boil until nearly tender and finish in the oven. Serve at
once. Sweet potatoes will bake in a shorter time than Irish
potatoes.</p>


<h4>Boiled Sweet Potatoes</h4>

<p>The most delightful boiled sweet potatoes I ever ate were
prepared in the following manner;<!--TN: as printed--> Cook pared potatoes in a
small quantity of water until nearly tender, drain if necessary
(but it ought not to be necessary), cover with a towel and let
stand on the back of the stove for an hour or longer, shaking
occasionally. Potatoes may be boiled until tender and laid on
a tin in the oven a few moments to dry.</p>


<h4>Mashed Sweet Potatoes</h4>

<p>Prepare and season the same as mashed Irish potatoes. Serve
with tomato cream sauce.</p>

<p><a id="Page_265" class="pagenum" title="265"> </a>
Or, put into oiled baking dish, sprinkle with crumbs and heat
in oven.</p>


<h3>Mashed Pumpkin</h3>

<p>Select a nice, rich, fine grained pumpkin, saw into halves,
remove the seeds and fibre with a spoon and cut into small pieces
without paring. Steam, or stew in a small quantity of water.
Drain if watery in cheese cloth. When dry, mash and season
with cream or butter and salt. Heat in double boiler or oven,
stirring. Serve in mound on hot dish, or put into baking dish,
sprinkle with crumbs and brown in oven.</p>


<h4>Baked Pumpkin</h4>

<p>Place halves of pumpkin from which the seeds have been removed,
cut side down upon a tin. Bake until tender and dry.
Scrape from the shell, mash, season and serve.</p>


<h4>Baked Pumpkin&mdash;Individual</h4>

<p>Cut pumpkin into not too small pieces and lay cut side down
on waxed paper in baking tin. Serve as baked potatoes.</p>


<h3>Radishes</h3>

<p>Wash radishes well with brush, trim off all but the small green
leaves, stand in ice water ½&ndash;1 hour. Serve on glass dish with
cracked ice, or in a bed of shredded lettuce or of spinach leaves,
or with a parsley border.</p>

<p>Pare winter radishes and cut into quarters. Serve sprinkled
with parsley, or as other radishes.</p>


<h3>Spinach</h3>

<p>Wash spinach the same as other greens, <a href="#Page_253">p.&nbsp;253</a>. Cook in
boiling salted water until tender, 10&ndash;30 m. Lift from the water
with skimmer into a colander. (Save water for soups and sauces.)
Press dry with a plate. Lay in hot pan and cut across a few
times but do not chop; return to colander, pressing in firmly, to
mold. Turn the dish in which it is to be served over the colander
and unmold. Garnish with triangles of toast and hard
boiled eggs. Pass oil, quarters of lemon or lemon juice, Sauce
Amèricaine or French or Mayonnaise dressing with it. Many
<a id="Page_266" class="pagenum" title="266"> </a>
prefer it with salt and oil alone. It may also be served with
cream sauce, or drawn butter with lemon juice.</p>

<p>Overcooking develops a strong flavor and causes spinach to
lose its bright green color.</p>

<p>When spinach is young and sweet, it may be cooked without
the addition of water by covering close and heating slowly at
first; but when there is danger of its being bitter it should be
cooked in plenty of water.</p>


<h4>Spinach with Cream&mdash;Delicious</h4>

<p>Pour hot cream over cooked spinach in vegetable dish.</p>

<p>Spinach is sometimes rubbed through a colander after cooking
and served with whipped cream, for luncheon or supper.</p>


<h3>Summer Squash</h3>

<p>Cut squash into inch thick pieces, steam, or stew in a small
quantity of water; drain in cheese cloth. Mash, season, heat and
serve.</p>

<p>If you ever use butter for seasoning in cooking, use it with
summer squash; though a little heavy cream, almond or dairy,
is very nice. Never use roasted peanut butter with squash.</p>

<p>Only those squashes which are young enough to cook with
the skins and seeds are suitable for stewing, as the skins and
seeds contain the flavor.</p>


<h4>Baked Ripe Summer Squash</h4>

<p>Bake whole; open, remove seeds, scrape pulp from skin, season
and serve as above. This pulp makes very delicate squash
cream pies.</p>


<h4>Summer Squash with Corn</h4>

<p>Add ½ cup stewed green corn to each pint of cooked summer
squash. Season with salt and cream.</p>


<h3>Winter Squash</h3>

<p>Winter squashes vary so much in quality that no one way of
cooking will do for all. There are some varieties from which
the skin may be peeled like a tomato, after steaming; others are
so hard that it is impossible to pare them; from these scrape out
<a id="Page_267" class="pagenum" title="267"> </a>
the pulp with a spoon after steaming; others still, are better to
be pared before steaming. When soft and watery after cooking,
dry in the oven before mashing, and again afterwards if necessary.
Some watery squashes have a rich flavor when well dried
out.</p>


<h4>Mashed Winter Squash</h4>

<p>Saw squash in halves, remove the seeds and fibre with a spoon,
cut into quarters or eighths, pare or not according to the variety,
lay inside down in the steamer and cook over boiling water until
tender. Remove from the shell if not pared, mash through a
fine colander, season if soft with butter or cream and salt, or
with salt only; if dry and mealy like the “Delicious,” use plenty
of milk and cream with salt. Beat well and serve.</p>


<h4>Mashed Baked Squash</h4>

<p>Bake halves of squash from which the seeds have been removed,
cut side down until tender, 1&ndash;2 hours or longer. Scrape
pulp clean from the shell, mash, add salt, beat well and serve.
Baked squash is so sweet that it requires no seasoning but salt,
though a little milk or cream may be added if it is very dry.</p>


<h4>Baked Squash&mdash;Virginia Way</h4>

<p>Bake pieces of desired size, the shell side up, on waxed paper
in baking pan. Serve on platter, allowing each guest to season
to taste, and eat from the natural dish.</p>


<h3>Tomatoes</h3>

<p>As the tomato, though a fruit, is prepared and served in so many
ways as a vegetable, we will follow custom and consider it under
that head; but it must be borne in mind that it should not be
served or eaten in combinations unsuitable for other acid fruits.</p>

<p>The most desirable way to serve the tomato is uncooked when
well ripened. When perfectly ripe the skin will peel off without
any preparation, and it may sometimes be loosened by rubbing
the tomato all over firmly with the back of a silver knife; but
when more convenient to use the hot water method, the tomatoes
do not need to be soft nor to have a cooked taste.</p>

<p><a id="Page_268" class="pagenum" title="268"> </a>
First&mdash;have a kettle with an abundance of perfectly boiling
water, also a pail with plenty of the coldest water you can get,
ice water if possible. Put a few tomatoes (not enough to cool
the water much) into a wire basket. Plunge into the boiling
water, let rest an instant if very ripe and a second longer if quite
solid, then lift the basket and set quickly into the cold water,
then turn the tomatoes out into the water and leave them there.
Repeat the process, take care each time that the water is boiling
before dipping the tomatoes into it and renew the cold water
when necessary.</p>

<p>Tomatoes may be put into the boiling water and transferred
quickly to the cold water with a skimmer. When thoroughly
cooled, set without peeling into the ice box until ready to use.</p>


<h4>Raw Tomatoes</h4>

<p>Peel, slice into not too thin slices, or cut into quarters or
sixths from the blossom end just deep enough for the pieces to
spread apart without separating. Serve with salt or with some
of the salad dressings as a garnish for meat dishes, or as fresh
fruit with sugar or sugar and lemon juice. With sugar and
heavy cream my grandfather used to think tomatoes were more
delicious than peaches and cream.</p>


<h4>Stewed Tomatoes</h4>

<p>Slice tomatoes into sauce pan and bring to boiling point slowly,
boil up well, only, season with salt and serve. Long boiling
frees the acid of tomatoes and renders them less wholesome.
Tomatoes require more salt for palatability than any other article
of food.</p>


<h4>Steamed Tomatoes</h4>

<p>Put rather small tomatoes on pan in steamer, steam from 10&ndash;15
m., or until tender. Serve on hot toast or crackers or thin
round slices of broiled nut meat with a dainty spray of parsley
or chervil, for luncheon or supper; allowing each guest to season
to taste. If desired, drawn butter, cream sauce or oil may be
passed.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_269" class="pagenum" title="269"> </a>
Broiled Tomatoes</h4>

<p>Cut tomatoes in halves without peeling, dust with salt and
fine cracker crumbs, broil over hot coals, skin side down, 15&ndash;20
m. Serve plain or with Sauce Amèricaine or any desired dressing
with wafers or toast. Firm tomatoes may be cut into thick
slices and broiled on both sides. They may be just browned
and set in the oven to become tender.</p>


<h4>Tomato Purée</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. stewed tomatoes</li>
  <li>1 or 2 sticks of celery</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. sugar</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. butter</li>
  <li>A few slices of onion</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. flour</li>
  <li>chopped parsley</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat tomatoes, crushed celery and sugar for 15 m. Simmer onion
in butter without browning, add flour, then tomato, boil up
well, strain and add chopped parsley. Serve on toast or with
boiled rice or with some meat dish. Very nice on toast with
sliced hard boiled eggs.</p>


<h3>Turnips</h3>

<p>The later varieties of turnip are by far the best though some
of the earlier varieties are sweet and tender. As they need to
be grown quickly turnips are never good in a dry season but will
be pithy and strong. Turnips require the greatest care in cooking.
If they are over-cooked 5 m., they will begin to turn dark
and will have a strong, disagreeable flavor. For that reason they
are better to be cut into thin slices. They must be boiled rapidly.</p>


<h4>Boiled Turnips</h4>

<p>Wash, cut into quarters or sixths if large, pare very thick, cut
into ½ in. slices, put into perfectly boiling water; boil rapidly for
25 m., or until just tender. Add salt at the end of 20 m. or
when nearly tender, if at all; nice, sweet turnips are delicious
without salt. Drain thoroughly, in cheese cloth if convenient.
Serve plain, or with Chili sauce, Sauce Imperial or Sauce Amèricaine;
or pour cream sauce over after draining; or pass oil, oil
and lemon juice or French dressing with them.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_270" class="pagenum" title="270"> </a>
Ruta-Bagas</h4>

<p>There are white and yellow ruta-bagas or Swedish turnips, and
both are richer in flavor and more nutritious than common turnips.
The yellow ruta-bagas are especially sweet and rich. Prepare,
cook and serve the same as turnips, except that the ruta-bagas
require a little longer time for cooking. They are delightful
served with Chili sauce, but are so rich and sweet of themselves
that no sauce is necessary.</p>


<h4>Mashed Turnips</h4>

<p>Mash well drained boiled turnips with potato masher in hot
pan. Do not put through colander. Season with salt and if
not sweet a little sugar. Serve plain or with <a href="#sauce_57">sauce 57</a>, <a href="#sauce_58">58</a> or <a href="#sauce_75">75</a>.</p>


<h3>Vegetable Stew</h3>

<p>Cook separately 1 pt. of string beans, 2 small potatoes and 2
small carrots cut into small pieces, and 1 pt. of green peas.
When tender, drain, put all together, add salt and cream or a
thin cream sauce.</p>

<p>This makes a very pretty as well as a palatable dish.</p>

<h2 id="CHESTNUTS"><a id="Page_271" class="pagenum" title="271"> </a>
CHESTNUTS</h2>


<p>Since chestnuts are so largely composed of starch though they
also contain a large proportion of albuminoids, from 8.5 to 14.6
according to different authorities, we allow them to follow vegetables
while not classing them with them. One writer says
“they might have been included among the bread stuffs.” London
vegetarians often serve a tureen of plain boiled chestnuts
in place of potatoes.</p>

<p>The recipes are for the large imported chestnuts. The smaller
native ones require a longer time for cooking. The dried chestnuts
which we sometimes find in the stores require 3 hours for
boiling.</p>


<h3>To Shell and Blanch Chestnuts</h3>

<p>Boil whole chestnuts rapidly for 10 m. Leave in the hot
water, shell and remove the brown covering while warm.</p>


<h3>Boiled Chestnuts</h3>

<p>Cook blanched chestnuts in salted water until just tender,
10&ndash;20 m.<!--TN: added period-->, drain, serve plain or with <a href="#sauce_14">sauce 14</a>, <a href="#sauce_16">16</a> or <a href="#sauce_17">17</a>. Or,
boil whole for 25 m. and serve in the shells.</p>


<h3>Chestnut Purée</h3>

<p>Mash boiled chestnuts, add salt, and cream or milk and butter.
Beat well, heat in double boiler, serve in center of platter surrounded
by nut meat cutlets or croquettes which in turn are
garnished with boiled small onions, Brussels sprouts or flowerets
of cauliflower suitably seasoned; or purée may be served with
globe artichokes, green peas, stewed cucumbers or mashed dry
green peas.</p>


<h3>Roasted Chestnuts</h3>

<p>Make at right angles small incisions at the point of the chestnut.
Bake 10&ndash;20 m. in a rather hot oven, stirring occasionally,
<a id="Page_272" class="pagenum" title="272"> </a>
or put into a corn popper and shake over the coals.</p>


<h3>Chestnut and Banana Salad with Cream Dressing</h3>

<p>Prepare bananas as suggested for salads, and cover with Cream
Dressing&mdash;Sweet. Cut boiled chestnuts in quarters and mix
lightly with bananas and dressing. Serve in cups or on dainty
china plates garnished with flowers or leaves.</p>


<h3>Chestnut Purée&mdash;Whipped Cream</h3>

<div class="subtitle">
For luncheon, supper or dessert
</div>

<p>Add sugar or honey with dairy or cocoanut cream and vanilla,
to mashed chestnuts; heat, pile on dish with spoon in rocky form
or force through vegetable press, and surround with whipped
cream.</p>


<h3>Vanilla or Raisin Chestnuts</h3>

<p>Boil blanched, fresh or dried chestnuts until tender (fresh 15
m., dried, 3 hours). When almost tender, add sugar or honey
to water and when the liquid is nearly boiled away, flavor with
vanilla; finish in slow oven; serve as confection. Raisin pulp
instead of vanilla is delightful.</p>




<h2 id="SALADS"><a id="Page_273" class="pagenum" title="273"> </a>
SALADS</h2>


<p>Since experience has taught us that the delicate machinery
of the body requires oil to keep it running smoothly, salads as
one of the most agreeable means of supplying this need, have
been growing in favor.</p>

<p>In our recipes for salad dressings, we have endeavored to give
sufficient variety in oils to suit all tastes and circumstances.</p>

<p>“Vinegar&mdash;acetic acid, is about ten times as strong as alcohol,
and makes more trouble in the stomach than any other acid
except oxalic.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">Dr. Rand.</i></p>

<p>“No acid should be taken into the mouth with starch as it
will prevent the action of the saliva; but if starches have been
properly masticated, and a proper amount of saliva mingled with
them, lemon juice will not interfere with the digestion of starch
in the stomach.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">Dr. Kress.</i></p>

<p>For the above reasons, we use no flour or cornstarch in dressings,
use lemon juice as the acid, and exclude potato salad.
Cold potatoes of themselves are difficult of digestion and combining
them with an acid renders them still more so.</p>


<h3 id="SECRETS_OF_SUCCESS">Secrets of Success</h3>

<p>Use nuts as a garnish, or as an accompaniment to salads instead
of mixed with them, as they become tough quickly after
touching the dressing. Coarse chopped nuts may be sprinkled
over the salad just as it goes to the table.</p>

<p>In beans, green or red French, Lima or California are best
for salads since they do not cook to pieces easily.</p>

<p>The whites of hard boiled eggs are more digestible when ground
fine, or pressed through a wire strainer. When desired for fancy
shapes they may be poached separate from the yolks, <a href="#Page_199">p.&nbsp;199</a>.</p>

<p>Vegetables for salads must be crisp, tender and dry.</p>

<p><a id="Page_274" class="pagenum" title="274"> </a>
Gather lettuce early in the morning, put it into a closed pail
or a paper sack and leave in the refrigerator for a few hours; or
if it comes from the market slightly wilted, cover it at once with
ice water until revived. Never allow the wind to blow upon
lettuce. Crisp, by allowing it to stand in ice water after washing
until just before serving, then drain and shake in a wire basket
or in mosquito netting, cheese cloth or a netted bag.</p>

<p>Celery, parsley, spinach, endive and dandelion may be kept
fresh the same as lettuce and crisped in ice water before serving.</p>

<p>Always cut celery, never chop it. Wipe<!--TN: was 'wipe'--> it dry before cutting
and if possible, roll in a dry towel a moment after cutting.</p>

<p>Unless cabbage is shaved thread-like it is better to be chopped.</p>

<p>In cooking carrots for salads, drain them when about half
done and add boiling water to finish cooking.</p>

<p>The apple, grape fruit and tomato are the only fruits with
which a French or Mayonnaise dressing is harmonious.</p>

<p>Dip ripe tomatoes quickly into perfectly boiling water, lift
them out and drop into cold water, change the water two or
three times if ice is not at hand, set them in a cold place, and
peel just before serving.</p>

<p>Do not mix cut, colored fruits (like strawberries) with cream
dressings. Lay the pieces between the layers and on top of the
salad.</p>

<p>It is seldom suitable to serve fruit salads with lettuce; some
glass dish with decorations of leaves, vines and flowers is prettiest.</p>

<p>As a rule, do not mix many kinds of fruit in one salad. One
flavor often destroys another.</p>

<p>Many of the fruit salads are suitable for desserts.</p>

<p>Cut oranges in about the middle of the section or just each
side of the membrane, leaving that out if convenient; then cut
into pieces crosswise.</p>

<p>Cut grape fruit in halves, then around the inside next to the
<a id="Page_275" class="pagenum" title="275"> </a>
skin, and after removing the pulp, carefully separate it from the
membrane.</p>

<p>When juicy fruits are to be used with any but fruit juice dressings,
they should be drained. The juices may be used for nectars,
other salad dressings or for pudding sauces.</p>

<p>Soak currants or pitted sour cherries in syrup made of one
part sugar and two parts water, for an hour or longer, then drain.</p>

<p>For most salads, bananas are better cut into quarters lengthwise,
then sliced across.</p>

<p>Pare, quarter and core choice, fine flavored apples, one at a
time, cut the quarters into not too thin lengthwise slices, place
three or four of the slices together and cut across into small
wedge-shaped pieces. Never chop apples for salad. Both apples
and bananas should be prepared just as short a time before the
meal as possible and should be cut right into the dressing. After
being coated with the dressing they will not turn dark.</p>

<p>Shred fresh pineapple according to directions, <a href="#Page_44">p.&nbsp;44</a>. For
nut and cream dressings cooked pineapple is preferable. After
draining and drying canned sliced pineapple, lay two or three of
the round slices together and cut into wedge-shaped pieces about
¼ inch across at the large end.</p>

<p>Keep orange, lemon, grape fruit or tangerine cups in cracked
ice or ice water until just before serving, then drain and wipe dry.</p>

<p>The edges of the cups may be pointed or scalloped, and if cups
are large the points may be cut deep, and then rolled down.
Apple cups may be kept in the same way, or the cut surface may
be coated with dressing.</p>

<p>We marinate or pickle some ingredients by mixing them with
lemon juice, with or without salt, or with French dressing, a
short time before serving. Drain if necessary, before adding
the dressing.</p>

<p>A wooden spoon which is used for nothing else is best for stirring
dressings while cooking. Dip in cold water and wipe it just
before using and wash in cold water immediately after.</p>

<p><a id="Page_276" class="pagenum" title="276"> </a>
Sour cream may be substituted for sweet cream in all dressings;
a little less lemon juice is required.</p>

<p>One-third water may be used with lemon juice for dressings if
too sour.</p>

<p>Use plenty of salt in dressings for people accustomed to mustard
and pepper.</p>

<p>For uncooked dressings all the ingredients and utensils should
be as nearly ice cold as possible.</p>

<p>The yolks of five eggs may be used in the place of three whole
eggs in boiled dressings.</p>

<p>For salads with eggs, tomatoes or cabbage, a larger proportion
of lemon juice and salt is required, and with tomatoes a little
sugar is an improvement.</p>


<h3 id="COOKED_DRESSINGS">COOKED DRESSINGS</h3>


<h4>★ Improved Mayonnaise Dressing</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>4 large eggs</li>
  <li>⅓ cup oil</li>
  <li>⅓ cup lemon juice</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat all the ingredients in the inner cup of a double boiler
just enough to blend well. Put into the outer boiler containing
warm (not hot) water, set over fire, stir with a wooden spoon
continuously, taking the inner boiler out occasionally and stirring
well if there is danger of cooking too rapidly. When the
dressing begins to thicken, remove at once from the fire and set
in a dish of cold water which was all ready, stirring until partially
cooled. Strain through a wire strainer.</p>

<p>The recipe for this dressing (with some unhygienic adjuncts)
was given to me in the early days of my work by a lady to whom
a famous chef had given it as a special favor; and to my mind
its value is unequalled. It has not an excess of oil like the regular
mayonnaise, is easily and quickly made and will keep well
in a cool place, covered. I sometimes use ½ cup of oil and ¼
cup of lemon juice, and sometimes just the reverse, according
to what I am using it over and the tastes of the people for whom
I am preparing it. Three eggs will do very well if one needs to
<a id="Page_277" class="pagenum" title="277"> </a>
economize in eggs. ¼ cup of cream, whipped, may be added
just before serving for Cream Improved Mayonnaise.</p>


<h4>Butter Dressing</h4>

<p>Use melted butter and less salt in improved mayonnaise
dressing.</p>


<h4>★ Boiled Salad Dressing&mdash;Large quantity</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>8&ndash;10 eggs</li>
  <li>1½ cup oil</li>
  <li>1 cup lemon juice</li>
  <li>2&ndash;3 teaspns. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Follow directions for improved mayonnaise dressing.</p>


<h4>No Oil Dressing</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>yolks of 2 eggs</li>
  <li>1 level teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. lemon juice</li>
  <li>whites of 2 eggs</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat yolks, add salt and lemon juice, cook over hot water,
cool; add stiffly-beaten whites of eggs when ready to serve.</p>


<h4>Sour Cream Dressing</h4>

<p>Especially good plain on lettuce, and with flavorings for
chopped cabbage.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. lemon juice</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. water</li>
  <li>½&ndash;¾ teaspn. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat egg slightly, add cream, cook the same as boiled custard,
cool, add water, salt and lemon juice. When desired, water
and lemon juice may be flavored according to directions <a href="#Page_28">p.&nbsp;28</a>.</p>


<h4>Sweet or Sour Milk Dressing</h4>

<p>Substitute sweet or sour milk and 1 tablespn. of oil or butter
for sour cream in preceding recipe. Omit water and use 2 eggs
if desired very stiff.</p>


<h4>★ Cream Dressing&mdash;Sweet</h4>

<p>For fruits especially, but suitable for lettuce, cabbage, beets,
celery or carrots.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
  <li>or ⅔ cup light cream</li>
  <li>3 tablespns. sugar</li>
  <li>3 large eggs</li>
  <li>3 tablespns. lemon juice</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="Page_278" class="pagenum" title="278"> </a>
Beat cream, sugar and eggs in inner cup of double boiler;
cook as for custard, set dish in cold water; add the lemon juice
gradually, stirring, then a trifle of salt, strain.</p>

<p>⅔ only of the cream may be cooked and the remainder
whipped and added to cold dressing. In substituting sour cream
for sweet, use 1&ndash;1½ tablespn. only of lemon juice.</p>


<h4>★ Nut Dressing&mdash;no eggs</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 slightly rounded tablespns.</li>
  <li>Brazil, almond, pine nut or</li>
  <li>roasted or unroasted peanut butter</li>
  <li>⅓&ndash;½ cup water</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>1&ndash;1½ tablespn. lemon juice</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub butter smooth with water, cook just a moment, stirring.
Remove from fire, add salt and lemon juice, cool.</p>

<p>Some flavoring is an improvement with the unroasted peanut
butter.</p>

<p>Roasted peanut butter dressing and improved mayonnaise
dressing may be combined with a very pleasing effect.</p>

<p>Use from ½&ndash;¾ cup strained stewed tomato in place of the
water, and ¾ teaspn. of salt, for Nut Tomato Dressing.</p>


<h4>★ Almond Butter Dressing</h4>

<p>Add 2 tablespns. of sugar to the nut dressing made with almond
butter and you have one of the most delightful fruit salad
dressings.</p>


<h4>Rhubarb Salad Dressing</h4>

<p>While the liberal use of rhubarb is not to be recommended on
account of the oxalic acid it contains, it affords variety in dressings
and has the advantage of always being at hand in the
country when one gets out of lemons.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>3 large or 4 small eggs</li>
  <li>¼ cup oil</li>
  <li>½ cup prepared rhubarb</li>
  <li>½&ndash;⅔ teaspn. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Stew rhubarb without peeling, with not more than one tablespoon
of water to the quart of rhubarb. Rub through a fine colander
or sieve, mix in the proportions given, with the other ingredients
and cook the same as improved mayonnaise dressing.</p>

<p><a id="Page_279" class="pagenum" title="279"> </a>
Green gooseberries prepared in the same way may be used in
the place of rhubarb.</p>


<h4>Olive Dressing</h4>

<p>Make “No Oil” dressing with 1½ only, tablespn. lemon juice
and just before serving sprinkle over it two tablespns. coarse
chopped ripe olives.</p>


<h4>Tomato Dressing</h4>

<p>Excellent on apples, string beans, celery, cabbage and lettuce,
on peas croquettes, and for decorating.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>3 large eggs</li>
  <li>¾ cup thick tomato pulp</li>
  <li>¼ cup oil</li>
  <li>3 tablespns. lemon juice</li>
  <li>1&ndash;1½ teaspn. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Drain juice from stewed tomatoes, rub pulp through strainer
or fine colander, combine with other ingredients and cook as
improved mayonnaise dressing.</p>


<h4>Orange Dressing</h4>

<div class="subtitle">
For suitable fruit salads.
</div>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1&ndash;1½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 cup water</li>
  <li>⅔ cup orange juice</li>
  <li>5&ndash;6 tablespns. lemon juice</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil sugar and water to syrup; cool, add orange and lemon
juice, strain. If desired, flavor with oil of orange.</p>


<h4>Boiled Dressing with Cornstarch</h4>

<p>I insert this dressing with many apologies for the cornstarch,
which as we know, is entirely out of place in a salad dressing,
and trust that it will be used in emergencies only when eggs are
very scarce.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 cups water</li>
  <li>½ cup corn starch</li>
  <li>2 teaspns. salt</li>
  <li>3 eggs or 4 yolks</li>

UNCOOKED DRESSINGS</h3>


<h4>French Dressing</h4>

<div class="subtitle">
Suitable for vegetables, apples, tomatoes, eggs, legumes and nut
foods.
</div>

<p>The proportions of lemon juice and oil in this dressing vary
from 1 part of lemon juice to 4 parts of oil, to equal parts of
each, and in extreme cases to the use of four or five times as
much lemon juice as of oil according to the ingredients of the
salad and individual taste, but the proportions most generally
used are the following:</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>¼&ndash;½ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>3 tablespns. oil</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. lemon juice</li>
</ul>

<p class="continued">Mix salt and oil well, add lemon juice slowly, stirring, pour over
salad, serve at once. If flavorings are used, mix them with the
salt and oil before adding the lemon juice. My experience is
that this method of combining the ingredients gives the best
results. A bit of ice may be added while stirring, but if ingredients
and utensils are ice cold it will not be necessary.</p>


<h4>Orange French Dressing</h4>

<p>Let orange juice stand for a few moments with thin shavings
from the outside of the rind in it, strain and combine with the
salt and oil as above, using equal quantities of oil and orange
juice or only ½ as much of the juice. Serve over sliced apples
or tomatoes.</p>


<h4>Grape French Dressing</h4>

<p>Equal quantities of grape and lemon juice with salt and a
small proportion of oil. Delightful over apples, oranges, grape
fruit, pears or peaches, or suitable combinations of the same.</p>


<h4>Honey French Dressing</h4>

<p>Use equal quantities of lemon juice and honey or three or
four times as much lemon juice as of honey, with oil and a trifle
of salt, over lettuce or suitable fruits. Honey and lemon juice
without the oil may be used by those who prefer it.</p>


<h4>Nut French Dressing</h4>

<p>Add water to any preferred nut butter until of the desired consistency;
<a id="Page_281" class="pagenum" title="281"> </a>
then salt and lemon juice according to the ingredients
of the salad. Butter from either Brazil, almond or pine nuts is
good. Raw pine nuts have much the flavor of cheese. If unroasted
peanut butter is used, the flavor of onion or garlic or
both is an improvement.</p>


<h4>Salad Entrée Dressing</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 tablespn. chopped parsley</li>
  <li>¾ tablespn. chopped onion</li>
  <li>¾&ndash;1 teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>¾&ndash;1 teaspn. celery salt</li>
  <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
  <li>⅓ cup lemon juice</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix dry ingredients, add oil, then lemon juice slowly, stirring.</p>


<h4>English Salad Dressing</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1½&ndash;2 tablespns. sugar</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. oil</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. lemon juice</li>
  <li>¼ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. shredded fresh mint, or ¼ teaspn. powdered dry mint</li>
</ul>


<h4>★ Lemonade Dressing</h4>

<div class="subtitle">
For lettuce and many fruits.
</div>

<p>1 tablespn. each of lemon juice and water to each slightly
rounded tablespn. of sugar. Stir until sugar is dissolved. For
juicy fruits, use lemon juice and sugar only.</p>


<h4>Tarragon Dressing</h4>

<div class="subtitle">
For fruits.
</div>

<p>1 teaspn. chopped tarragon to each half cup of lemonade
dressing.</p>


<h4>Orange Dressing</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>¾ cup orange juice</li>
  <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
  <li>3 tablespns. sugar</li>
  <li>rind of ⅛ of an orange</li>
</ul>

<p>Cut thin slices from the yellow part of the rind; let stand
with the other ingredients for 15 m. Strain and pour over fruit.
Omit rind for strawberries, pineapple and such other fruits as it
will not harmonize with.</p>


<h4>Raspberry Juice Dressing</h4>

<p>Add sugar flavored with oil of orange, with lemon juice, to
rich red raspberry juice, the proportions depending upon the
<a id="Page_282" class="pagenum" title="282"> </a>
sweetness of the raspberry juice. Serve over apple or apple and
orange.</p>


<h4>★ Quick Cream Dressing&mdash;Sweet</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>5 tablespns. cream</li>
  <li>1½ tablespn. sugar</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>lemon juice to thicken, perhaps about 1 tablespn.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix cream, sugar and salt, add lemon juice slowly, stirring
until dressing is thick, and be sure to stop when it is thick.</p>


<h4>★ Whipped Cream Dressing</h4>

<div class="subtitle">
For shredded lettuce, chopped cabbage or cooked beets, and some
fruits.
</div>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>3 tablespns. lemon juice</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. sugar</li>
  <li>⅛ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>¼&ndash;⅓ cup of cream</li>
</ul>

<p>Whip cream,<!--TN: added comma--> sugar and salt together, chop lemon juice in lightly.</p>


<h4>Sour Cream Dressing</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. to 2 tablespns. lemon juice</li>
  <li>½&ndash;1 teaspn. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Whip cream until just thick, add lemon juice and salt which
have been mixed. For lettuce or apples, use such flavorings as
fresh mint, tarragon, onion, chives, celery salt or seed when
desired.</p>

<p><b>For Sweet Dressing of Sour Cream</b>&mdash;Add 1½ tablespn. of sugar
to lemon juice in above recipe.</p>


<h4>Sour Milk Dressing</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>¼ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>⅔ cup sour milk</li>
  <li>1&ndash;1½ tablespn. lemon juice</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat yolks with salt, add milk, then lemon juice gradually,
stirring, then the stiffly-beaten whites of the eggs. For a sweet
dressing add 2 tablespns. of sugar to the whites of the eggs.</p>


<h4>Mayonnaise Dressing</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>yolk of 1 egg raw (some use 2 or 3)</li>
  <li>½&ndash;1 teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>1 cup to 1 pt. of oil</li>
  <li>1&ndash;1½ tablespn. lemon juice to each cup of oil</li>
</ul>

<p>Use only 1 cup of oil unless a very thick dressing is required.
<a id="Page_283" class="pagenum" title="283"> </a>
Have all utensils and ingredients cold. In very hot weather
only, set dish in which dressing is made on chopped ice or in ice
water. Use a soup plate with a silver or wooden fork, or a bowl
with revolving egg beater. Beat yolk of egg and salt, add ½&ndash;1
teaspn. lemon juice, mix well, then add oil, drop by drop at first,
stirring constantly (one way, some say). After a little, oil may
be added faster. When mixture becomes thick, stir in a little
lemon juice. Do not allow it to get too thick before adding
lemon juice. When done the dressing should drop, not pour,
from a spoon.</p>

<p>If mixture shows signs of curdling, set dish on ice, continuing
to stir, and if it does not become smooth then, add a teaspoon
of cream or a little white of egg or a few drops of lemon juice,
beating well. Or, take another yolk, begin again more carefully,
and when well started add the curdled portion slowly.</p>

<p>If a hard boiled yolk is crushed and worked smooth with a
spatula and mixed thoroughly with the raw yolk, the dressing is
not so apt to curdle and the oil may be added a little more rapidly.</p>

<p>The tendency to curdling is very much lessened by adding the
lemon juice to the yolk before any oil is added.</p>


<h4>Cream Mayonnaise</h4>

<p>Add ½ or an equal quantity of whipped cream, or ½ to 1
stiffly-beaten white of egg to mayonnaise at serving time.</p>


<h4>Green Mayonnaise</h4>

<p>Macerate with a spatula or in a mortar spinach, parsley or
chervil, tarragon, chives or green tops of onions, using a little
lemon juice if necessary. Express the juice and add to dressing.</p>


<h4>Mayonnaise Cream</h4>

<p>Whip ¼&ndash;½ cup of heavy cream, chop into it the beaten yolk
of an egg, add salt and lemon juice to taste. Chopped parsley
may be sprinkled through the dressing, or a little green or red
vegetable coloring may be used in it.</p>


<h3 id="TRUE_MEAT_SALADS"><a id="Page_284" class="pagenum" title="284"> </a>
TRUE MEAT SALADS</h3>

<p>For these salads, rich in proteids, the nut dressings are not required.
As a rule, lemon juice, lemon juice and salt, or the
French dressing with suitable flavorings will be most appropriate.
Use the different varieties of Mayonnaise with judgement.</p>


<h4>★ ★ Trumese and Celery Mayonnaise</h4>

<p>Take equal quantities (or any proportion desired) of diced trumese
and slender crescent slices of celery with a little very fine
chopped onion. Mix lightly with improved mayonnaise dressing.
Pile in center of lettuce border. Serve. Trumese may have
been marinated. Onion may be omitted. Nasturtiums, parsley,
fringed celery or other garnishes may be used with or without
the lettuce.</p>


<h4>Hot Nut Meat Salad</h4>

<p>Make a custard of the yolk of one or two eggs or one whole
egg, and one cup of rich milk; add salt, a little grated or chopped
onion, celery salt if desired and two cups of diced trumese
which has been marinated with two tablespns. of oil, 1 or 2
tablespns. of lemon juice and a little salt. Heat without over-cooking
the egg. Serve on toast or in the center of large wafers
with stalks of fringed celery or with a sprinkling of sliced crisp
celery.</p>


<h4>Green French Bean and Cucumber Salad</h4>

<p>In the center of a lettuce or spinach leaf border place stewed
green French beans surrounded by a row of sliced cucumbers.
Garnish with white, green or yellow mayonnaise.</p>

<p>The combination of the different shades of green is very pretty.
The addition of nasturtiums gives a different effect.</p>


<h4>Novel Legume Salads</h4>

<p>Prepare different colored legumes according to directions for
mashed lentils, <a href="#Page_185">p.&nbsp;185</a>, very dry. Mold in block shaped tins and
when cold cut into cubes and serve in any desired border with
improved mayonnaise dressing. A rail fence of cucumbers sliced
lengthwise may constitute the border. The French dressing
<a id="Page_285" class="pagenum" title="285"> </a>
may be used, but there is nothing quite equal to a mayonnaise
dressing for mashed legumes.</p>


<h4>Legume Roses</h4>

<p>While warm, press mashed green peas or other legumes (a
little softer than for molding) through pastry tube in form of
roses. Garnish with a delicate vine and lemon points, or with
the yellow mayonnaise.</p>


<h4>★ Helianthus (Sunflower) Mayonnaise</h4>

<p>This salad is to be served on individual plates. When it is
the principal dish for luncheon, use one egg to each plate, but
with a variety of other dishes two eggs will be sufficient for three
plates.</p>

<p>Make a deep border of shredded tender lettuce leaves around
a gilt edged plate. In the center of the plate, pile as high as
possible the yolk of a hard boiled egg which has been pressed
through a wire strainer. Surround this with a border of the
white which has also been vermicellied. Then drop with a teaspoon
improved mayonnaise dressing at frequent regular intervals
on the lettuce border. This salad gratifies the senses of
both sight and taste.</p>


<h4>Salad Marguerite</h4>

<p>Cut hard boiled eggs in halves lengthwise. Lay the halves on
the vegetable board, the flat side down, and cut each half carefully
into four pieces. Remove yolk from pieces, rub through
wire strainer, place in center of individual plates and surround
with a wreath of shredded lettuce or of tender spinach leaves.
Then place pieces of white inside down over the wreath, radiating
from the center. Serve with French dressing, or with
roses of yellow or green mayonnaise around the outside.</p>


<h4>Cottage Cheese and Radish Salad</h4>

<p>Surround a molded border of cottage cheese with radish lilies
on<!--TN: was 'n'--> lettuce, endive, parsley, chervil or spinach border and fill the
center<!--TN: was 'enter'--> with green mayonnaise.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_286" class="pagenum" title="286"> </a>
★ Cottage Cheese and Pear Salad</h4>

<p>Pour French dressing in which drained canned pears whole
or in halves, have been soaked for an hour or two, over a mound
of creamy cottage cheese. Surround with the pears and garnish
with geranium leaves or ferns. Serve with crackers or cocoanut
crisps.</p>


<h4>Additional Combinations</h4>

<h3 id="VEGETABLE_SALADS">VEGETABLE SALADS</h3>


<h4>★ Snow Salad. Cabbage</h4>

<p>Add just as it is going to the table, whipped cream dressing, to
1 pt. of chopped crisp white cabbage. Some of the whipped
cream may be left out of the dressing and dropped by spoonfuls
on top of the salad.</p>


<h4>Lavender or Pink Salad</h4>

<p>Use purple or red cabbage in the place of white in snow salad.
For luncheon, the cream mayonnaise dressing may be used.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_287" class="pagenum" title="287"> </a>
Pink Salad No.&nbsp;2</h4>

</ul>

<p>Beat eggs in the inner cup of a double boiler, pour slowly over
them stirring, a boiling mixture of all the remaining ingredients
except the cabbage; add the cabbage and cook until just creamy.
Serve at once.</p>


<h4>Cold Slaw</h4>

<p>Cool hot slaw, and just before serving, add ¼ cup of cream,
whipped. The slaw is excellent without the cream, however.</p>


<h4>Cauliflower Salad</h4>

<p>Serve flowerets of cauliflower, cooked according to directions,
<a href="#Page_246">p.&nbsp;246</a>, masked with improved mayonnaise or with cream improved
mayonnaise dressing on a bed of shredded lettuce in a

Pass dressing.</p>


<h4>★ Dominion or French Sam’s Salad</h4>

<p>Skim from a pan of thick sour milk, equal quantities of cream
and milk. Beat lightly together and mix with nice crisp shredded
lettuce and salt. I wish I could tell you how highly I prize
this recipe. Try it.</p>


<h4>English Salad</h4>

<p>Tear in pieces with the fingers, nice crisp lettuce, mix with
it a few leaves of shredded fresh mint, and pour English salad
dressing over. Serve at once.</p>


<h4>Spinach Leaf Salad</h4>

<p>Select the tender inside leaves of spinach, wash well and
serve with French or mayonnaise dressing or in almost any way
that lettuce is used, the flavor of which they almost excel.</p>


<h4>Salad à la Russe, or Russian Salad</h4>

<p>Combine as great a variety of starchless vegetables in different
<a id="Page_288" class="pagenum" title="288"> </a>
colors as convenient. Celery, onions, carrots, beets, green peas,
red and green French beans and string beans make a good combination.
Turnips, asparagus, cauliflower, chives and parsley
may be used also, and some like a flavoring of celery seed.</p>

<p>Cut the larger vegetables into small pieces or dice, or into
fancy shapes with vegetable cutters (the pieces left after cutting
out the shapes with vegetable cutters may be chopped and
used as the base of the salad, or for another salad or for soup);
cut the string beans into diamond shapes and chop the onion
very fine. Pile the lightly mixed vegetables in the center of a
border of lettuce or spinach leaves; lay some of the brightest
pieces on the top and pour French dressing over all.</p>


<h4>Beet and Olive Salad</h4>

<p>In the center of a platter with a lettuce or variegated beet
leaf border, place marinated sliced or chopped beets. Surround
the beets with roses of cream mayonnaise or mayonnaise cream
with stoned ripe olives between.</p>


<h4>Cucumber and Onion Salad</h4>

<p>Cut short crisp cucumbers in halves lengthwise, hollow out
the center to within a half inch of the rind, pare shells carefully
and drop into ice water. Slice or chop the centers, mix with
fine cut raw onion, salt and French or improved mayonnaise
dressing. Drain and thoroughly dry shells, fill with mixture, lay
on leaves of lettuce, sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve.
Cut long cucumbers into two-inch lengths, remove centers, set
rings upright on lettuce and fill. Pass dressing if more is desired.</p>


<h4>Asparagus Mayonnaise</h4>

<p>Place six-inch stalks of cooked asparagus in rail fence style
just inside a lettuce or endive border on a platter, with lemon
cups of mayonnaise (one for each person to be served) in the
center.</p>

<a id="Page_289" class="pagenum" title="289"> </a>
dressing without the water in the proportion of one cup

an hour or longer, then serve over young string beans which have
been cooked in salted water until tender. Canned stringless or
string beans may be used.</p>


<h4>Stuffed Tomato Salad</h4>

<p>Fill hollowed out tomatoes with a mixture of drained, salted,
grated cucumbers<!--TN: was 'cucmbers'-->, fine chopped onion and improved mayonnaise
or French dressing. Serve in nest of lettuce with dressing.</p>

<h3 id="FRUIT_SALADS">FRUIT SALADS</h3>


<h4>★ Apple and Pineapple Salad with Cream Dressing</h4>

<p>Prepare apples and pineapple, equal quantities, or ⅓ only of
pineapple, according to directions on <a href="#Page_275">p.&nbsp;275</a>. Just at serving
time, combine with cream dressing&mdash;sweet, and serve in dainty
glasses or cups (individual), each on a small plate with a doily
and a cut flower or leaf or a spray of some delicate vine. This
is a sample of what may be done with any of the followings
combinations and many others:</p>

<p>Apple with orange or strawberries, red raspberries, canned
cherries, cherries and celery, or celery.</p>

<p>Banana with apple or strawberries, red raspberries, pineapple,
orange or celery.</p>

<p>Pineapple with orange, red raspberries, strawberries, cherries
or celery.</p>

<p>Orange with red raspberries, strawberries, cherries or celery.</p>

<p><a id="Page_291" class="pagenum" title="291"> </a>
Fresh ripe peaches, seeded sweet grapes with solid flesh, and
sweet apples are among the suitable fruits for salads.</p>

<p>The almond butter dressing is as desirable as the cream dressing.</p>

<p>Pear and apple or apple or pineapple alone with the almond
dressing are especially delightful. The whipped cream dressing
may be used when more convenient.</p>


<h4>★ Currant and Red Raspberry Salad</h4>

<p>1 pt. each red raspberries and very ripe currants, 1 or 2 teaspns.
of fine chopped tarragon, basil or sassafras leaves, with lemonade
dressing of 1½ tablespn. each of lemon juice and water
and two tablespns. of sugar. Serve in glasses or cups with suitable
decoration. The flavorings may be omitted.</p>

<p>Pineapple with either the currants or raspberries without the
flavorings is excellent. Orange and red raspberries; grape fruit
and strawberries; apple and strawberries; apple, grape fruit and
strawberries or orange; apple, banana and strawberries and other
combinations of juicy fruits will suggest themselves from the
preceding. When a sweeter fruit than currants is used the proportion
of sugar in the regular lemonade dressing is sufficient.</p>


<h4>★ Mint Fruit Salads</h4>

<p>Oranges or grape fruit or apples with shredded mint and
lemonade dressing (water omitted in first two) are the most
delightfully refreshing of salads.</p>

dressings, then in chopped nuts. Serve on individual plates
with a spoonful of dressing, with orange points and candied
cranberries or cherries, or frosted currants for garnish.</p>

one of the sweetened cream dressings. Prepare apple also with
the dressing and place the two in high alternating diagonal rows
on a platter with lettuce border; or prepared apples may be

<h2 id="DESSERTS_AND_PUDDINGS_WITHOUT_EGGS"><a id="Page_294" class="pagenum" title="294"> </a>
DESSERTS AND PUDDINGS WITHOUT EGGS</h2>



<h3>★ Apple Dumpling&mdash;Baked</h3>

<p>Peel, quarter and core nice tart apples, lay inside down, in
flat pudding dish or pan, cover and set in gentle heat so that
the apples will become just warm all through.</p>

<p><i>Crust</i>&mdash;Make universal crust with ½ to 1 cup of liquid according
to the quantity required. Roll ½&ndash;¾ in. thick, cut with biscuit
cutter, lay close together on warm apples. Cover with a
pan that will allow the crust to rise underneath it, set in warm
place and let crust get very light.</p>

<p>Start the dumplings early enough to give plenty of time at
each stage. When crust is light, bake uncovered at first, in
moderate oven ¾&ndash;1 hr., or until apples are well cooked and
crust thoroughly baked. Serve with creamy, or hard sauce, or
with sugar and nut or sterilized dairy, cream. Do not put any
sugar, butter, salt or water on the apples. Leave them plain
to contrast the apple flavor with the sauce. A pastry crust may
be used with the apples, but is not so satisfying. A crust of
boiled rice laid over the apples and baked covered, is very nice
with them.</p>


<h3>★ Apple Dumpling&mdash;Steamed</h3>

<p>Place the apples in the bottom of an oiled kettle (aluminum
preferably), the same as in the pudding dish for baking. Pour
warm water over to one-third or one-half cover, or just enough
to cook them without scorching. Cover apples with crust as in
baked dumpling. Let crust rise very light, cover the kettle
close (put a weight on the cover), and set in moderately hot
place over the fire. When boiling well, carefully move the
kettle back where it will boil slowly but steadily. Place an asbestos
pad under it if necessary. Cook without removing the
<a id="Page_295" class="pagenum" title="295"> </a>
cover 25&ndash;30 m. from the time it begins to boil. Serve with any
sauce suitable for baked dumplings.</p>


<h3>Peach Dumplings</h3>

<p>Cut universal dough into rounds as large as a saucer, pile halves
of peaches in center, press edges firmly together around peaches,
lay in deep pan and bake when crust is light. Serve with almond
or dairy cream or any suitable sauce. Or, cut rounds smaller,
lay peaches on one and cover with another. Wet edges and
press together.</p>


<h3>★ Fruit Tarts or Dumplings</h3>

<p>Put blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, gooseberries, cranberries
or any desired fruit in the bottom of a pudding dish; mix
sugar, a little flour and salt together and add to berries. (Blueberries
will require a little water.) Warm, and cover with crust
as for baked apple dumpling. Bake when crust is light and serve
without sauce.</p>

<p>Cranberries and gooseberries may be baked with very little if
any sugar and served with hard sauce.</p>

<p>A tart of unsweetened peaches is nice served with plain or
whipped cream.</p>


<h3>★ Blueberry Pot Pie&mdash;Delicious</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>Universal crust of ¾ cup milk</li>
  <li>3 pts. berries</li>
  <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
  <li>¾ tablespn. lemon juice</li>
  <li>¾&ndash;1 cup water</li>
</ul>

<p>Put blueberries with sugar in bottom of preserving kettle, pour
water over, cover with crust, let rise and cook the same as
steamed apple dumpling. No sauce.</p>

<p>Cranberry and gooseberry pot pie may be made in the same
way and served with hard or creamy sauce.</p>


<h3>Orange Roly-Poly</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>4 oranges</li>
  <li>⅔&ndash;1 cup sugar</li>
  <li>⅓&ndash;½ teaspn. grated rind</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Peel all white from oranges. Divide into unbroken sections.
Make universal crust of 1 cup of milk with a large measure of oil.
When light, add salt with flour to make a dough stiff enough to
<a id="Page_296" class="pagenum" title="296"> </a>
roll; roll in oblong sheet, spread with orange sections, sprinkle
with sugar, roll close and carefully, moisten the edges at the
ends and pinch well together. Bake in moderate oven 35&ndash;45 m.,
or steam 1½ hour. Serve with lemon, hard, or foamy white
sauce, or with cream.</p>


<h3>Dutch Apple Cake</h3>

<p>Spread a thin layer of universal crust on shallow baking pan;
press warm eighths of apples, sharp edge down, into crust,
sprinkle with sugar, let rise, bake, covered part of the time if
necessary to cook the apples; serve as “tea-cake,” or with sauce
as pudding. Let dough extend up the sides of the pan a little
to keep the juice from running off.</p>

<p>Make <b>Peach Cake</b> the same way, with halves or slices of
peaches.</p>


<h3>Short Cakes</h3>

<p>Bake universal crust in flat square or round tins. Split, spread
with butter or not, and cover lower half with a generous layer
of fruit. Turn the upper half over so that the cut side is up,
and cover that, too, with fruit.</p>

<p>A meringue or fluff may be used sometimes for ornamentation,
but if fruit is properly prepared and freely used, cream will not
be required; it would better be saved for some more necessary
place.</p>

<p>Two very thin crusts may be used, but the fruit flavor does
not penetrate them as it does the split crust. Make the crust
stiff enough to give a fine grain but not so stiff as to be hard.
It may be baked in not too thick biscuit for individual serving.</p>

<p>Crusts may be baked several days beforehand and kept closely
covered. To serve, dip in cold water, slip in paper bag, set in
hot oven for about 10 m. and use as fresh baked crust.</p>

<p>Do not use cake, or a sweetened crust, and call it “shortcake.”</p>

<p>One in writing of strawberry short cake says: “It must be
remembered that the fruit must be served on a <em>genuine shortcake</em>
not the sweet cake of the restaurant and of too many
<a id="Page_297" class="pagenum" title="297"> </a>
households, but the plain, unsweetened cake that was the delight
of our fathers, and which is still the joy of those who have been
so fortunate as to have made the acquaintance of the blessings
of the tasty and nutritious cookery of the olden times.”</p>

<p>Some unsweetened, flaked, cereal preparations, crisped in the
oven, make delightful shortcakes by sprinkling a few flakes on a
plate, covering them with prepared fruit, then sprinkling the
fruit generously with flakes. They must be served as soon as
prepared.</p>


<h3>Shortcake Fillings</h3>

<p><b>Strawberries</b>&mdash;Leave out a few small berries or cut some of
the smaller ones in halves or quarters and set one side. Save
also some of the largest and cut into halves, or leave whole with
the stems on. Put a little butter into a granite pan, add berries
with not too much sugar and a little salt. Crush over the
fire with wire potato masher just enough to make juicy. Mix
well with butter, stir carefully until just warm. Add small berries,
spread crusts, place whole berries, or cut halves cut side up,
on top. Serve shortcake at once on dessert tray or platter with
a cluster of ferns or geranium or other green leaves at the side.</p>

<p>Or, cut berries in small pieces just before serving, sprinkle
crust with sugar mixed with a trifle of salt. Cover with berries
and sprinkle with sugar, lay on upper crust and cover the same.</p>

<p>Or, chop not crush berries with sugar and serve with sweetened
juice of berries or with crushed strawberries sweetened, to
be dipped over each slice as served.</p>

<p><b>Raspberries</b>&mdash;red or black&mdash;Prepare and serve same as strawberries.</p>

<p><b>Blueberries</b>&mdash;Stew berries with sugar and water, add a little
lemon juice, a trifle of salt and thicken a little, hardly enough
to know they are thickened, with corn starch.</p>

<p><b>Peaches</b>&mdash;Cut into eighths or slice, fresh ripe peaches just
before serving. Lay them over thin crusts and sprinkle with
sugar. Arrange pieces around the outside edge of the top crust
and serve with nut or dairy cream.</p>

<p><a id="Page_298" class="pagenum" title="298"> </a>
Or, stew halves of peaches in syrup, thicken syrup a little
with corn starch and add a bit of butter, lay peaches inside up,
on crusts and pour juice over. Juice may be delicately flavored
with almond. A little lemon juice may be added.</p>

<p><b>Apricots</b>&mdash;fresh&mdash;Prepare the same as peaches.</p>

<p><b>Apricots</b>&mdash;dried&mdash;Soak over night, add 1&ndash;1½ cup sugar to 1
lb. of fruit, heat slowly, just boil, remove fruit and spread over
cakes, leaving 1 qt. of juice. To this add ½ cup of sugar and
thicken with 4 level tablespns. corn starch. Add 1 tablespn.
lemon juice and if desired, 2 tablespns. butter. Pour over shortcake,
or preferably serve with it.</p>

<p><b>Prunes</b>&mdash;Stew prunes with a little sugar, stone, cut into small
pieces and spread on crust; thicken juice a trifle and turn over
all. Prune shortcake is delicious served with almond cream
or covered with whipped cream. A little lemon juice may be
added to the prunes.</p>

<p><b>Honey</b>&mdash;Split and butter crust; spread thick with honey,
serve hot.</p>

<p><b>Maple</b>&mdash;Cook maple syrup and butter or cream together and
serve warm over crust.</p>

<p>Canned fruits of nearly all kinds may be used in the winter
for shortcakes by thickening the juice a little with corn starch.</p>


<h3>Steamed Blueberry or Other Fruit Pudding</h3>

<p>Make ingredients for universal crust into stiff batter or soft
dough, according to the juiciness of the fruit to be used with it;
mix and beat well, let rise; add dried or fresh blueberries (huckleberries),
cranberries, raspberries, blackberries, fresh or dried or
drained canned, cherries, or any convenient fruit; put into well
oiled mold, cover or not and steam 1&ndash;1½ hour. Serve with
cream and sugar, or with foamy, hard or cocoanut sauce.</p>

<p>Or, make a dough stiff enough to knead, shape into biscuit,
fold and press berries in while shaping, lay balls on pie pan, let
rise and steam. Or, make into one large loaf, and steam. Figs
or dates cut with shears into small pieces may be used and the
<a id="Page_299" class="pagenum" title="299"> </a>
pudding served with orange or any of the sauces already given.</p>


<h3>★ Plain Steamed Pudding</h3>

<p>Steam sweetened or unsweetened universal crust in large or
individual molds ¾&ndash;1 hour; serve with molasses, maple, berry,
foamy or creamy sauce.</p>


<h3>★ Dutch Boiled or Steamed Pudding</h3>

<p>Make universal crust with only ¼ cup of oil to the cup of liquid
and mix as stiff as bread dough. Put into a well buttered double
cheese cloth, let rise, drop into perfectly boiling water and boil
30&ndash;40 m. Remove from cloth, split and lay on dessert tray,
spread with butter, cover with nice flavored molasses and serve
hot. Try it before you condemn it. The crust may be steamed
instead of boiled, but it is beautifully light when boiled. Molasses,
or maple or brown sugar syrup may be heated with a little
butter and served over pudding as sauce.</p>


<h3>Cottage Pudding</h3>

<p>Bake rather stiff, slightly sweetened universal crust and serve
with Annie’s Strawberry (“<i>o</i>” of Hard Sauce Variations) or any
preferred sauce. Add fine cut, drained stewed prunes to pudding
occasionally before baking and serve with a sauce made of
the juice.</p>

water may be put in the dish. Bake about 1 hour in all.</p>


<h3>Mary’s Scalloped Apple Pudding</h3>

<p>Put a layer of quartered apples, sugar and a trifle of salt in the
bottom of a pudding dish, then a sprinkling of dry bread crumbs;
continue layers to fill the dish, leave crumbs on top, pour over
all water to cook slowly for several hours until apples are a rich
red color. Serve with or without cream or other sauce. If preferred
the pudding may be baked with less water for a shorter
time. Use cracker crumbs instead of bread and you have a
different pudding.</p>


<h3>Scalloped Raspberries, Blueberries or Peaches</h3>

<p>Put fruit and crumbs or very thin slices of bread in layers in
pudding dish, sprinkle each layer with sugar and have crumbs on
top. Cover and bake about ½ hr., uncover to brown, serve

with cream sauce.</p>


<h3>Bread and Currant Pudding</h3>

<p>Put small pieces of dry bread in pudding pan, sprinkle with
English currants, pour enough hot, slightly salted water over to
moisten well, bake in moderate oven 1&ndash;2 hours. Serve with any
desired sauce or nut or dairy cream.</p>

<p>Or, sprinkle sugar over bread before adding water and serve

<h3>Irish or Sea Moss Blanc Mange</h3>

<p>Sea or Irish moss is so desirable as a food that it should be
used more generally. It can be bought at groceries or drug
stores at from 25 cts. per lb. upward, according to where it is
bought. Do not confound it with Iceland moss.</p>

<p>It is useless to try to follow any exact rule either by weight
or measure for the proportion of moss to the milk, yet the preparation
is simple. Take up a little in the fingers, what might
be called a small handful, wash it in several cold waters until all
the sand is removed. Drop it into the milk cold or warm. (It
is very convenient to have it tied loose in 2 or 3 thicknesses of
netting, cheese cloth is too fine.) Cook in the inner cup of a
double boiler, or in a pail set in hot water, lifting the netting
<a id="Page_309" class="pagenum" title="309"> </a>
up and down occasionally, until the milk is of a creamy consistency;
then remove moss if it is in the netting, if not, strain
through a fine wire or hair strainer. Sweeten, and flavor with
vanilla or rose, or leave plain. (Some prefer the seaweed flavor.)
Turn into a large pudding mold or individual cups or molds
which have been dipped in cold water. It will harden very
quickly in a cool place. Serve with fruit juice, stewed fruit
or cream. Pineapple sauce is very suitable.</p>

<p>“Far too much sugar is used in food. Cakes, sweet puddings,
pastries, jellies, jams are active causes of indigestion. Especially
harmful are the custards and puddings in which milk, eggs and
sugar are the chief ingredients.</p>

<p>“The free use of milk and sugar taken together should be
avoided.”</p>

<p>Desserts made of tart fruits and bread should be avoided by
those with a tendency to acid stomach.</p>

<h3>★ Steamed Crumb Pudding</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. hot milk</li>
  <li>1&ndash;1¼ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
  <li>¼&ndash;½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. vanilla</li>

<h3>Steamed Cabinet Pudding</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>3 eggs</li>
  <li>3 tablespns. sugar</li>
  <li>3 cups milk</li>
  <li>1 cup fruit (currants, raisins, citron), chopped fine</li>
  <li>3 pts. stale bread or cake crumbs</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

  <li>1 qt. milk</li>
  <li>3&ndash;4 eggs</li>
  <li>3&ndash;4 tablespns. sugar</li>

<p>Beat eggs with sugar just enough to blend whites and yolks,
add milk, stir until sugar is dissolved; cook, stirring over hot
water until the custard thinly coats the spoon; remove quickly
from fire, add flavoring if desired and strain into pitcher or glass
sauce dish; serve cold.</p>

<p>Or, pour hot milk slowly stirring, over beaten eggs and sugar,
strain and pour into buttered custard cups, set in pan of hot
water, bake slowly until creamy all through, or till a silver knife
will come out clean when run into custard. Do not allow the
water around the cups to boil at any time. Cool as rapidly as
possible. The straining of custards has much to do with their
smoothness and lightness. If the boiled custard should curdle
from too long cooking, beating with the dish in cold water may
restore the smoothness, but not the flavor.</p>

<p>In making a large quantity of custard, set as soon as creamy
into cold water and stir until below the coagulating point or the
custard will become curdled by its own heat.</p>

possible; drain, remove the stones and chop the prunes, not too
fine. Beat the whites of 3 eggs to a stiff froth with a little salt
and ¼ cup of sugar. (Be sure to use the sugar in the eggs
instead of in the prunes.) Chop prunes in lightly, bake in pudding
dish or brick shaped granite pan in slow oven until egg is
set, about 20 m. Serve cold with plain or whipped cream.
Almond cream flavored with vanilla is nice.</p>

through colander. Add the whites of 4 eggs stiffly-beaten with
4 to 6 tablespns. sugar, set in pan of water, bake slowly until

to the white of each egg, sugar to suit the fruit, and a little

<h2 id="PUDDING_SAUCES"><a id="Page_324" class="pagenum" title="324"> </a>
PUDDING SAUCES</h2>


<p>“The pudding is nice and the sauce is nice, but the tart of
the lemon destroys the flavor of the fig,” was the kindly criticism
which my fig pudding with lemon sauce received from one
of the ladies of the class in the junior days of my public work.</p>

<p>To combine desserts and sauces properly requires true artistic
skill. As a rule, a rich sauce should be served with a plain pudding
and a simpler or neutral sauce with a richer pudding, or
with one having a characteristic or delicate flavor. Cream&mdash;almond,
Brazil nut, cocoanut or dairy is the only thing that will
develop the flavor of some desserts, while some puddings are too
good to be spoiled with any sauce.</p>


<h3>★ Creamy (Apple Dumpling) Sauce</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½ cup butter</li>
  <li>1 cup sugar</li>
  <li>½ cup milk</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. vanilla</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream butter and sugar, add milk gradually, stirring; set over
hot water and stir until just smooth, no longer. The sauce is
not intended to be hot. Add vanilla and serve at once.</p>

<p>If the sauce should stand and separate, heat carefully again
before serving. Water may be used in place of milk, or lemon
juice and water in equal quantities, with lemon flavor, or fruit
juices for cottage or plain steamed puddings. Orange juice with
the flavor of the rind and vanilla makes a pleasing combination.
The sauce is sometimes made with cream and sometimes with
¼ cup each of cream and fruit juice.</p>


<h3>Strawberry or Raspberry Sauce</h3>

<p>Add 1 cup mashed, drained, canned or fresh strawberries or
raspberries to above sauce just before serving.</p>

<h2 id="VEGETABLE_GELATINE"><a id="Page_335" class="pagenum" title="335"> </a>
VEGETABLE GELATINE</h2>


<p>In the seaweed, Agar Agar, which comes from the rocky
coasts of the East India islands, we have a most delightful vegetable
gelatine. Besides being clean and pure and sweet, it is
inexpensive. An ounce of Agar Agar will solidify from two to
four times as much liquid as an ounce of animal gelatine. The
method of its use is very simple.</p>


<h3>Directions</h3>

<p>Pour water that feels quite hot to the finger over the gelatine
and let it stand covered in a warm place for an hour or longer.
When ready to use, drain and to the hot water drained off add
sufficient boiling water to make 4 cups (1 qt.) for each ounce of
gelatine. Pour over gelatine and cook (taking care that it does
not boil over) in covered vessel until clear, which will be in not
over 2 or three minutes if the gelatine was well soaked.</p>

<p>For fruit juices and nearly all liquids, 1 oz. is sufficient for 16
cups (4 qts.), including the water in which it was boiled. The
exceptions will be noted in the recipes. This proportion makes
that delicate, quaking jelly always so desirable.</p>

<p>In warm weather a little more gelatine may be required, and
the proportions vary slightly with different qualities of gelatine.</p>


<h3>Secrets of Success</h3>

<p>Keep cooked gelatine warm by setting dish in hot water (may
be cooked in inner cup of double boiler, then set into outer boiler)
until ready to use.</p>

<p>Leave molds quite wet. Set in cold room or on ice or in ice
water. When cold surroundings are not obtainable, use a smaller
proportion of liquid. Do not unmold until just before serving
time.</p>

<p>If for any reason gelatine becomes solidified or partly so after
<a id="Page_336" class="pagenum" title="336"> </a>
boiling, before molding, boil it up again as nothing less than boiling
heat will make it smooth.</p>

<p>When the gelatine is to be cooked in stock or milk, do not
have water for soaking quite so hot.</p>

<p>Unless a very transparent jelly is desired, straining after cooking
is unnecessary with a good quality of gelatine. The very
cheapest quality may require several strainings but I question the
economy of its use. Strain, if at all, through a double thickness
of cheese cloth (wrung out of hot water) into a hot vessel.</p>

<p>Pour cooked gelatine into liquid all at once, stir just enough
to mix well, and turn immediately into molds. Do not stir
while cooling.</p>

<p>For freezing, use ⅓&ndash;½ less of gelatine and ⅓ more of sugar
in recipes.</p>

<p>To unmold jelly, run a thin bladed knife around the edge carefully,
when necessary; turn the dish on which it is to be served
over it and invert quickly; shake gently. If the mold was not
drained too much, there will be no necessity for using a warm,
wet cloth or warm water to loosen jelly.</p>

<p>Use jellies with fresh pineapple the day they are prepared.</p>

<p>When whipped cream is used, add all or a part of the sugar to
it before mixing it with the other ingredients.</p>

<p>The whites of the eggs must be beaten with all or nearly all of
the sugar of the recipe to combine well.</p>

<p>If directions are followed carefully, vegetable gelatine desserts
will be found among the easiest to prepare, as well as very delightful.</p>

<p>The recipes are all for Agar Agar or gelatine in bulk.</p>

<p>In each recipe, the quantity of water in which the gelatine is
to be cooked immediately follows it.</p>


<h3>Fruit Jellies</h3>

<p>The simplest and most desirable of gelatine desserts are the
molds made of fruit juices, either of one variety alone, or of harmonious
combinations such as red raspberry and currant, strawberry
<a id="Page_337" class="pagenum" title="337"> </a>
and currant, strawberry and pineapple, and grape and peach
(¼ grape and ¾ peach). Cherry, cranberry, gooseberry, apricot
and orange are among the many juices suitable for jellies.</p>

<p>The fruit itself cut fine may sometimes be used in connection
with the juice, pineapple especially.</p>

<p>The addition of lemon juice gives character to nearly all fruits.
Add water and sugar to make not too rich.</p>

<p>Jellies may be served plain, with fruit juices, or with whipped
cream or custard; or with egg or whipped cream sauce.</p>

<p>When obtainable, the fruit and leaves of the fruit used in the
jelly make suitable decorations.</p>

<div class="title"><i>Proportions</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>¼ oz. gelatine</li>
  <li>1 cup water</li>
  <li>3 cups fruit juice</li>
</ul>

<p>The water is that in which the gelatine is to be cooked. Prepare
the juice, cook the gelatine (after soaking) and pour it, <em>all
at once</em>, into the juice. Stir just enough to mix well and pour
into molds. This quantity will make about 12 good sized individual
molds.</p>


<h3>Delicate Lemon Jelly</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>¼ oz. gelatine</li>
  <li>1 cup water</li>
  <li>½ cup lemon juice</li>
  <li>large ¾ cup sugar</li>
  <li>2½ cups water</li>
</ul>


<h3>Fruit and Mint Jelly</h3>

<p>Make delicate lemon jelly with 1 cup of sugar. Pour some
of it into the bottom of a mold, keeping the remainder hot.
When cold, but hardly beginning to set, drop small pieces of grape
fruit pulp into it and sprinkle with shredded fresh mint. Cover
with more jelly. Next, place a layer of slices of red skinned apples
around the edge with another sprinkling of mint. Have the
next layer of green skinned apples, and finally cover with jelly.
Follow general directions for cooling and unmolding. Other
fruits may be used.</p>


<h3>Beets in Jelly</h3>

<p>Layers of sliced or diced boiled red beets may be molded with
lemon jelly with pleasing effect.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_338" class="pagenum" title="338"> </a>
Orange Jelly</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>¼ oz. gelatine</li>
  <li>1 cup water</li>
  <li>½ cup lemon juice</li>
  <li>1½ cup orange juice</li>
  <li>1 cup water flavored with rind of orange</li>
  <li>½&ndash;⅔ cup of sugar</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat sugar and water together until sugar is dissolved. The
orange pulp need not be strained out of the juice.</p>


<h3>Orange or Lemon Jelly with Strawberries</h3>

<p>Press ripe whole, or pieces of strawberries into jelly quickly
when just cold and beginning to set slightly. Serve with whipped
cream garnished with slices of berries. Red raspberries may be
used instead of strawberries.</p>


<h3>Jelly in Orange Cups</h3>

<p>Orange jelly with or without fruit may be molded in cups the
size of orange cups, transferred to them at serving time and finished
with a meringue or a fluff or with whipped cream.</p>


<h3>★ Wedding Breakfast Salad</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>⅛ oz. gelatine</li>
  <li>½ cup water</li>
  <li>½ cup pineapple juice</li>
  <li>⅓ cup lemon juice</li>
  <li>⅔ cup water</li>
  <li>⅔&ndash;1 cup sugar</li>
  <li>2 small oranges</li>
  <li>2&ndash;3 bananas</li>
  <li>1 cup very dry shredded pineapple</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat the sugar and water together, remove from fire, add the
lemon and pineapple juice and gelatine; then the fruit which
has been cut into small pieces. Put into molds and set on ice.
Use the day it is made. Serve plain or with whipped cream.</p>

<p>I once saw this salad served with two orange cups tied together
with baby ribbon the color of the bride’s dress, having the
whipped cream piled in one cup and the jelly cut into cubes in the
other.</p>

<p>Of course the jelly should be cut just before serving.</p>


<h3>Red Jelly with Fruit</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>¼ oz. gelatine</li>
  <li>1 cup water</li>
  <li>scant 3 cups cranberry juice</li>
  <li>¾&ndash;1 cup sugar</li>
  <li>4&ndash;6 drops lemon extract</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="Page_339" class="pagenum" title="339"> </a>
Stew berries in an equal quantity of water and strain for juice.
Pour half of liquid into mold. Let it set slightly, keeping the
remaining half hot. Cover with shredded or cut fruit (oranges,
bananas, pineapple, well drained canned pears or peaches) and
pour remainder of liquid over. Allow jelly to become very firm.
Serve with garnish of whipped cream or rich meringue flavored
with lemon or rose. Dark red cherry and lemon juice make a
most delightful jelly without the flavorings.</p>


<h3>★ Orange Garnish for Salad or Cold Entrée</h3>

<p>Cut a small hole in one end of as many oranges as desired.
Carefully scoop out the pulp, leaving the rinds whole. Soak in
cold water an hour or more. Drain and wipe dry on the inside,
then leave in cold place until well dried.</p>

<p>Make a jelly in the proportion of&mdash;</p>

  <li>⅔ cup sugar</li>
  <li>(or the same quantity of liquid, using cherry and lemon juice)</li>
</ul>

<p>When nearly cold, carefully fill cups, harden, and at serving
time cut the oranges in sixths or eighths, rind and all.</p>

<p>Orange, lemon and other fruit jellies may be used by taking
only 1¾ cup of liquid besides the water in the gelatine.</p>

<h3>The Medical Use of Agar Agar</h3>

<p>Quite recently the use of agar agar as a remedy for constipation
has been discovered. “Life and Health” says: “Agar Agar,
a vegetable gelatine prepared from East Indian seaweeds, has
been given an official recommendation by the Council of Pharmacy
as a remedy for constipation.”</p>

<p>One physician suggests cutting it into small pieces and eating
it with cream as a porridge. It may also be served with fruit
juices and other liquids.</p>

<p>The liquid should be poured over it a few minutes before
serving, to moisten it sufficiently for mastication. A druggist
said, however, that it might be chewed dry.</p>




<h2 id="PIES"><a id="Page_347" class="pagenum" title="347"> </a>
PIES</h2>


<p>Pies are not necessarily unwholesome articles of diet. They
may be just good rich unleavened bread and fruit. Perhaps the
greatest objection to pies occasionally, is the length of time it
takes to make them, for paste that will make a tender crust cannot
be rolled out in a hurry. It is better to have something else
for dessert when one has not time to make a good pie.</p>


<h3>Suggestions</h3>

<p>Always use pastry flour (winter wheat) for pie crust. Bread
flour requires more shortening, creeps together when rolled and
does not make a nice, tender crust when you have done your
best with it.</p>

<p>Always use pastry (never bread) flour for thickening cream or
lemon pies. If cream pies are not to be used the day they are
baked less flour will be required. Lemon pies should be used
the day they are baked.</p>

<p>Apple and all fruit pies require a little flour in the filling, for
the flavor as well as to absorb the juice. A little salt develops
the flavors of fruits. Mix the flour, sugar and salt together and
put enough of it over the under crust to cover it well in order to
prevent the crust from soaking and to allow the sugar to cook
up through the fruit.</p>

<p>Berry pies may have most of the sugar mixture stirred with
them before putting into the crust. A little browned flour may
sometimes be added to the mixture for apple pies.</p>

<p>Do not peel rhubarb for pies.</p>

<p>To keep the juice from running out, wet strips of pliable cloth
2 or 3 in. wide (bias better) and wrap around the edge of pies
where the crusts join, so that half is on the top crust and half
under the edge, and press close all around.
<a id="Page_348" class="pagenum" title="348"> </a>
Milk or hot or cold water may be used; leave the strips quite
wet; remove from pies while hot; they may be used several times.</p>

<p>Another method is to make a small opening in the upper crust
and insert a little roll of paper, like a chimney, to allow the
steam to escape.</p>

<p>It is a good plan, also, to put the upper crust on to the pie as
loose as possible; lift it and make wrinkles in it all around, back
from the edge of the pie, before pressing the two crusts together;
this will keep the steam and juice in the pie instead of forcing
them out.</p>

<p>One way to make the edges stay together is to wet the edge
of the lower crust and sprinkle flour over it (shaking off what
does not adhere) just before filling and putting on the upper crust.</p>

<p>If with all your care the juice begins to run out, either at the
edge or through the openings in the crust, remove the pie at
once from the oven and let it stand on the hearth or table until
it stops boiling. (If necessary, put a little dry flour in the space).
Return to the oven and by slow cooking it may not run out again;
if it does, take it out again, but do not leave it out until the
fruit is perfectly cooked. It would be too bad to waste all the
labor of making a pie by serving it underdone.</p>

<p>Make pies without under crust when preferred. Put a strip of
paste around the edge of a shallow pudding dish or deep pie pan,
fill dish with prepared fruit, sugar and flour, cover with a lid of
paste, press on to the strip and bake.</p>

<p>Fillings of squash, pumpkin or sweet potato pies may be baked
on pie pans, in custard cups or in pudding dishes, without a crust,
and with or without a meringue.</p>

<p>Serve fruit pies the day they are baked. Those that are unavoidably
left over, put into the oven and just heat through
before serving, to make like fresh pies.</p>

<p>Apple pies may be put together at night, kept in the ice box
and baked the next morning.</p>

<p><a id="Page_349" class="pagenum" title="349"> </a>
For custard or other deep pies, cut the crust with the shears
about ½ inch larger than the pan, moisten the under side of the
edge slightly and pinch it up with floured thumb and finger so
that it will stand up above the edge of the pan. The crust may
be pinched up before trimming and cut around the edge of the
pan with a knife. It is a good plan to set the prepared crust in
the ice box long enough to become firm before filling.</p>

<p>Crust may be put on to several pans when making pies one
day and baked when desired.</p>

<p>Several crusts can be baked at a time, then just heated before
using.</p>

<p>To bake before filling without blistering, put pastry on to one
pan, set another of the same size into it and bake between the
two.</p>

<p>Another way is to cover the pastry with paraffine paper and
fill to the depth of ½ in. with flour. The partially browned
flour may be used in soups and gravies afterwards.</p>

<p>Fill pastry-lined patty pans with raw rice, cover with an upper
crust and bake when baked patty cases are desired. The rice
will not be injured and the crusts will keep their shape.</p>

<p>Sometimes with two-crust pies, sprinkle sugar over the top of
the crust when done and leave in the oven for two minutes.</p>

<p>Lattice work of strips of crust put on in diamonds or squares
makes an attractive finish for such lemon and orange pies as will
hold the strips up, as well as for cranberry and mince pies.</p>

<p>Beat whites of eggs for meringue with woven wire spoon or
silver fork until stiff; add ½&ndash;1 tablespn. of sugar to each white
and beat till very stiff, add flavoring, pile in rocky form on to
hot pie, bringing meringue well out over the crust; brown delicately
on top grate of moderate oven. As soon as the tips are
tinted the meringue is done. Overbaking makes it tough and
causes it to draw away from the edges. Having the pie hot
when the meringue is put on helps to cook it more evenly and
keeps it from becoming watery next to the pie.</p>

<p><a id="Page_350" class="pagenum" title="350"> </a>
When but one white is to be used for a meringue, do not beat
it quite so stiff and use a little more sugar so that it will spread
over the top of the pie well.</p>

<p>Tiny dots of beaten jelly may be placed with a pastry tube in
the depressions of the meringue of lemon pies, after baking.</p>

<p>In cutting pies with a meringue, cut just through the meringue
first with a thin bladed knife dipped in cold water; afterwards
cut to the bottom.</p>

<p>Pies should always be left so that a current of air will pass
under them while cooling to keep the crust from soaking.</p>


<h3>★ Pastry for one Large Pie</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2½ cups flour, salt</li>
  <li>large ⅓ cup of cooking oil</li>
  <li>1&ndash;1½ teaspn. lemon juice</li>
  <li>ice water</li>
</ul>

<p>Have all ingredients as nearly ice cold as possible. Dip the
flour lightly into the cup with a spoon, do not shake it down.
Mix salt with flour; pour oil over and chop it in with a spoon;
do not mix much. Put the lemon juice in a cup, add water to
make ¼ of a cup, and pour over the flour and oil mixture, adding
enough more water to make a rather soft dough; chop all
together with a spoon, press into a mass without kneading, roll
out without mixing on a well floured board, with a well floured
rolling pin. A little more oil will be required when lemon juice
is not used.</p>

<p>Nut or olive oil may be substituted for cooking oil, with a
slightly smaller proportion of olive oil. Olive oil does not, of
course, harmonize as well in flavor with all fillings as the others.</p>

<p>⅓ farina may be used in crust, with less shortening.</p>

<p>In mixing crust for several pies at once, not quite so large a
quantity will be required for each.</p>

<p>Keep crust that is left each time well covered in a cool place
and when making pies again, chop or grind it and mix it with the
flour before adding the oil. It will make the new crust more flaky.</p>


<h3>“Pie Flakes”</h3>

<p>Mix flour, salt and oil for a quantity of pies. Put into a large,
<a id="Page_351" class="pagenum" title="351"> </a>
close covered jar (or tin pail lined with waxed paper) and set in
cold place. To make a pie, take out about 2⅓ cupfuls, add
water and mix and roll as usual.</p>


<h3>Hot Water Crust</h3>

<p>Mix together equal quantities of oil and boiling water and pour
over flour which has been mixed with salt.</p>

<p>This crust rolls out more easily than ice water crust but is not
as tender and flaky. A slightly larger proportion of oil may be
used, but if too rich, the crust cannot be handled at all.</p>


<h3>★ Cream Pastry</h3>

<p>Mix flour and salt and pour enough thick sweet or sour cream
over to roll out well. The thicker the cream, the better the
crust will be. Sour cream makes more crisp and tender crust
than sweet and has not the least sour taste when baked.</p>


<h3>Butter Crust</h3>

<p>Rub together ½ cup (¼ lb.) butter and 2 cups (½ lb.) flour;
wet with ice water to make of a rollable consistency, press into
a mass and set in the ice box. When thoroughly chilled, roll
⅓&ndash;½ inch thick; spread with butter, sprinkle lightly with flour,
roll up, cut across the roll and roll pieces out thin for the pie.
Butter pastry is not tender even when much pains is taken with
it and the flavor is not agreeable.</p>


<h3>Bread Pie Crust</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>4 slices small loaf of bread</li>
  <li>boiling milk, salt</li>
  <li>6 tablespns. oil</li>
  <li>2&ndash;2½ cups flour</li>
</ul>

<p>Dip slices of bread in boiling milk, cool, add oil, salt, and flour
to roll. This makes two under crusts.</p>


<h3>Nut Meal Crust</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 cups flour</li>
  <li>1 cup home made peanut meal</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>cream</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix flour, meal and salt, pour enough moderately rich cream
<a id="Page_352" class="pagenum" title="352"> </a>
over to make a paste to roll out. A little oil may be added to
the meal and flour, and water used in place of cream.</p>


<h3>★ Granella Crust</h3>

<p>For one good sized pie take about ½ cup of granella (less if
fine, more if coarse, but it is better not to be too coarse nor too
very fine). Mix a little salt with it and pour over it quickly,
enough rich milk or thin cream to moisten it slightly, about ¼
cup, perhaps. (If too moist, the crust will be soggy.) Turn
immediately on to the pan and spread and press it evenly with a
spoon over the bottom and sides, dipping the spoon often into
cold water. A teaspoon is best for the sides, and holding the
forefinger of the left hand above the edge of the pan as you are
pressing with the spoon makes the edge of the crust firmer and
smoother. Do not let the crust come over the edge of the pan,
because only that part which adheres to the filling will come
out with the pieces of pie when served; the remainder will drop
off and be wasted. For that reason the crust should be just as
thin as it is possible to pat it out on the pan. Be careful to
make the crust in the angle between the bottom and sides of the
pan no thicker than in any other part. The novice usually fills
that in rounding. A positive pressure of the teaspoon in pressing
the paste up on the edge of the pan will remove the extra
portion there.</p>

<p>In baking these crusts before filling, watch them that they do
not get too brown, and handle them carefully.</p>

<p>I have been thus explicit because this is of all pie pastes the
most important hygienically and in point of time. It is very
quickly and easily made, in fact, it must be made quickly. If the
crust stands long after the liquid is added, it does not spread well.</p>

<p>In making a large number of pies, mix each crust separately;
you will save time. Zwieback crumbs may be used instead of
granella and almond or cocoanut cream in place of dairy. The
cream must be thin or the crust will not spread well.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_353" class="pagenum" title="353"> </a>
Granella Crust No.&nbsp;2</h3>

<p>Allow scant ⅔ cup of granella to each pie. Measure up the
quantity required. Mix the salt with it and pour oil over in
the proportion of ½ tablespn. of oil to each pie. (¾ tablespn.
melted butter may be used and no salt.) Rub all well together
with the hands, take out enough for each pie at a time, wet
with cold water and proceed as in the preceding recipe. This
mixture will need to be quite wet to spread.</p>

<p>Zwieback crumbs may be used for this also.</p>


<h3>Fillings for Granella Pies</h3>

<p>The pulp of stewed prunes, peaches, apricots or dried apples,
or other not too juicy materials, with or without a meringue or
whipped cream, or a sprinkling of dry granella on the top.</p>

<p>Cooked fillings of cream or lemon pies are delightful in the
baked crusts.</p>

<p>If you have not a pie knife, use two broad flat knives in serving
a pie with granella crust.</p>


<h3>★ Apple Pie</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>5 or 6 medium sized, tart, juicy apples</li>
  <li>¼ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>⅓&ndash;¾ cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. flour</li>
  <li>crust</li>
</ul>

<p>Prepare apples according to directions for apple sauce, <a href="#Page_47">p.&nbsp;47</a>,
cut the quarters in two if large, then in halves crosswise. This
will give irregular shaped pieces which when placed in the crust
will allow spaces for the steam to come in contact with the fruit
and cook it more quickly and thoroughly than when packed in
slices.</p>

<p>Mix the sugar, flour and salt for each pie in a bowl by itself.
When the bottom crust is on the pan, spread about half the
sugar mixture over it, put in a generous quantity of apples so
that when baked the pie will be level, not depressed, and sprinkle
the remainder of the mixture over, taking pains to have a little
more at the edges because of not having any underneath there.
It is very disappointing to find the last mouthfuls of pie near
the crust less sweet than the first from the center.</p>

<p>Be sure that the edge of the under crust is moistened, lay on
<a id="Page_354" class="pagenum" title="354"> </a>
the upper crust as directed, press the edges down well, trim off
the extra crust (unless you fold it under the bottom crust), and
with the thumb and forefinger press the edges well together.</p>

<p>Make incisions in the crust with a sharp pointed knife for the
steam to escape, bind the edges with strips of cloth and bake in
a moderate oven, turning occasionally, for ¾&ndash;1 hour. To be
sure that the apples are tender try them with a broom splint
through the spaces in the crust.</p>

<p>Brown sugar or molasses may be used to sweeten apple pies
once in a while as some people are very fond of those sweets.
The nice dried greening apples that we get sometimes may be
soaked over night and used the same as fresh apples.</p>


<h3>Other Fruit Pies</h3>

<p><b>Apple and Elder-berry</b>&mdash;1½ pt. apple prepared as for apple
pie, 1 pt. elder-berries, ¾ cup sugar, 1 tablespn. flour, 2 teaspns.
lemon juice, salt. Lemon juice may be omitted. A smaller proportion
of elder-berries maybe used and the pie still be delicious.</p>

<p><b>Dutch Apple</b>&mdash;Fill a buttered pie plate with apples without
sugar, dot with bits of butter, cover with a rather thick crust
and bake. Invert on dessert plate, sprinkle with sugar (mixed
with coriander if liked) and serve hot.</p>

<p><b>Phoebe’s, Delicious</b>&mdash;Nearly fill the crust with dry, nicely seasoned,
fresh apple sauce; cover with a ⅓ inch layer of raspberry
jam which has been beaten so as to spread well; bake. The jam
may be put on after the pie is baked, or both apple and jam may
be put into a baked crust. The pie may have a meringue, but
Phoebe’s didn’t.&mdash;It may also be baked with two crusts.</p>

<p><b>Rhubarb and Apple</b>&mdash;1¼ qt. rhubarb, ⅓&ndash;½ cup thick, slightly
sweetened, strained apple sauce, 1½ cup sugar, 2½ tablespns.
flour, ¼ teaspn. salt. Mix apple sauce with rhubarb and proceed

flour, ¼ teaspn. salt, 2 crusts. Bake well.</p>

<p><b>Black Currant</b>&mdash;Black currants with sugar, flour, salt and
water make a delicious pie. They should not be laid too thick
in the plate. A layer of thin slices of apple with the currants
is good.</p>

<p><b>Currant and Raspberry</b>&mdash;About ⅓ raspberries to ⅔ currants,
sugar, flour, salt.</p>

<p><b>Currant and Raisin</b>&mdash;2½ cups red currants, 1 cup chopped
raisins, ¾ cup sugar, 2 tablespns. flour, ¼ teaspn. salt.</p>

  <li>1 tablespn. butter</li>
  <li>3 eggs</li>
  <li>juice and pulp of 2 oranges</li>

<h3>CREAM PIES</h3>

<p><b>Cream&mdash;Par excellence</b>&mdash;1½ pt. rich milk, ⅔ cup flour laid
lightly in cup, scant cup of sugar, 2 eggs, salt, 1 teaspn. vanilla.
Mix flour, salt and sugar, put into oiled saucepan, pour boiling
milk over, stirring until smooth, boil, add yolks of eggs, just heat,
add vanilla, turn into baked granella or pastry crust. Meringue.
With some brands of pastry flour, a scant measure only will be
required. Thin slices of banana may be laid on the baked crust
before the filling is put in, for banana flavor.</p>

<p><b>Cocoanut Cream&mdash;Famous</b>&mdash;Same as cream pie with ¾ cup
sugar only and about ¾ cup desiccated cocoanut. (If cocoanut
is fresh grated, use 1 cup sugar.) Add cocoanut just before putting
filling into crust, reserving enough to sprinkle the top of
<a id="Page_362" class="pagenum" title="362"> </a>
the meringue before baking. Do not brown the meringue, just
heat it until it puffs up and possibly tints the tips of the cocoanut.</p>

<p><b>Nut Cream</b>&mdash;Use chopped hickory or other nuts in place of
cocoanut in Cocoanut Cream Pie.</p>

<p>★ <b>Farina Cream</b>&mdash;Scant pt. rich milk, 1 tablespn. Hecker’s,
1½ tablespn. Am. Cereal Co’s farina, ⅓ cup sugar, 2 eggs (3
eggs enough for 2 pies), 1 teaspn. vanilla. Heat milk and sugar
to boiling, sift in farina and cook for ¾&ndash;1 hour in double boiler;
add slightly beaten yolks of eggs, just heat through, remove from
fire, add flavoring, turn into baked granella or pastry crust.
Meringue. Thin slices of banana may be used to flavor this pie
also but it is delicious with no flavoring. Farina may be cooked
45 m. only, yolks and flavoring added and the filling be baked
in the crust.</p>

<h3>Cream of Rice</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. rich milk</li>
  <li>⅓ cup rice</li>
  <li>⅓ cup sugar</li>
  <li>pinch of salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook all together until thick and creamy. Turn into baked
crust, brown delicately over the top, cool.</p>

<p>Better the second day. Do not use with granella crust.</p>

<p><b>Caramel Cream</b>&mdash;Steep ¼&ndash;⅓ cup cereal coffee in milk of
cream pie, in double boiler for 15 m., strain through 2 thicknesses
of cheese cloth, add milk or cream to make 1½ pt. Finish
the same as cream pie. Flavor with vanilla.</p>

<h3>My Mother’s</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. thick cream</li>
  <li>⅓&ndash;½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. flour</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix and bake in 1 crust; serve in very small pieces. No flavoring
but that of the cream is required and no meringue is
necessary as the cream gives a beautiful finish to the top of
the pie.</p>

<h3>Parched Corn Cream</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2⅔ cups rich milk</li>
  <li>¼ cup parched corn meal</li>
  <li>⅓ cup sugar</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>3 eggs</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak corn meal in milk 1 hour, cook until thickened; add

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>1½ tablespn. flour</li>
  <li>½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>salt</li>

white beaten to a stiff froth and stirred in last.</p>

<h3>Sour Cream</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2½ cups sour cream</li>
  <li>2½&ndash;3 tablespns. flour</li>
  <li>1 cup sugar</li>

thicken but do not boil; add flavoring, turn into baked crust.
Meringue with whites of eggs.</p>

<h3>White Cream</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>whites of 3 eggs</li>
  <li>2 level tablespns. flour</li>
  <li>½&ndash;1 cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 pt. cream</li>
  <li>flavoring</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="Page_364" class="pagenum" title="364"> </a>
Beat whites with sugar, add other ingredients which have been
mixed together; bake in 1 crust.</p>

<p><b>Custard Pie</b>&mdash;2½ cups rich milk, ⅓ cup sugar, 3 eggs, salt.
Dusting of coriander or anise, or any suitable flavoring.</p>

<p><b>Custard Pie that Makes Its Own Crust</b>&mdash;1½ pt. rich milk (or
scant 1½ pt. skimmed milk and 1½ tablespn. of butter), ⅓&ndash;½
cup sugar, 3 eggs, 4 tablespns. flour, salt; almond, lemon or coriander
flavoring. Mix ingredients, stirring flour with milk and
pour into an oiled pie pan. Bake very slowly.</p>

<p>The flour will settle to the bottom and form a delicate crust.</p>

<p>Use 1 more egg, mix ingredients with 2 whole eggs and 2 yolks
more, then add the 2 whites stiffly-beaten, at the last. This
makes a more attractive pie.</p>

<p><b>Custard Pie Without Milk</b>&mdash;4 eggs, 3 or 4 tablespns. sugar,
salt, 1 pt. boiling water, flavoring. Beat 2 whole eggs and 2
more yolks with sugar and salt, pour boiling water over gradually,
stirring, pour into crust, dust with coriander, bake; meringue with
whites of 2 eggs. Vanilla, lemon or orange flavoring may be
used in the pie. The whites may be beaten stiff and stirred
into the filling before baking instead of adding the meringue.</p>


<h3>Rice Pie</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 good pint rich milk</li>
  <li>1 cup well cooked rice</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>4 tablespns. sugar</li>
  <li>vanilla, or no flavor</li>
</ul>

<p>Dust with coriander sometimes. May beat eggs separate and
add whites last. One crust.</p>


<h3>Crumb Pie</h3>

<p>Line the pan with crust, put into it a large pint of rather dry
bread crumbs (cracker crumbs may be used) and turn over them
sweetened, thin cream to fill the crust. Bake. Serve warm or
cold. Any desired flavor may be used.</p>


<h3>★ Crumb Pie No.&nbsp;2</h3>

  <li>ground coriander seed or other flavoring</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="Page_365" class="pagenum" title="365"> </a>
Mix crumbs, sugar and flour, add milk to beaten egg and pour
over dry ingredients, stirring, turn into crust, dust with coriander,
bake in moderate oven. Lemon or vanilla flavoring may be used
in the pie but they do not compare with the dusting of ground
coriander seed.</p>


<h3>Buttermilk Pie. Excellent</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1½ pt. buttermilk</li>
  <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
  <li>scant ½ cup flour</li>

meringue with orange.</p>


<h3>Sour Milk Pie&mdash;Mock Lemon</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>1 cup sugar</li>
  <li>1⅓ tablespn. corn starch</li>
  <li>2½ cups sour milk</li>
  <li>lemon flavor</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

  <li>1 cup sour milk</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. butter</li>
  <li>flavoring if desired</li>

  <li>1 cup mashed sweet potato</li>
  <li>½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>yolks of 2 eggs</li>
  <li>2 cups rich milk</li>

<h3><a id="Page_366" class="pagenum" title="366"> </a>
Squash Pies. Two large</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2½ cups squash, not very dry</li>
  <li>1 scant cup sugar</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. flour</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>1 qt. rich milk</li>
  <li>1½ teaspn. vanilla</li>
  <li>a few drops of almond flavor</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix sugar, flour and salt and stir into squash. Break eggs in
and beat a little, add milk gradually, then flavoring, bake in
moderate oven.</p>

<p>With 3 cups of squash use a little less flour. For variety,
flavor with lemon or vanilla only, or with neither and stir in a
little cocoanut, sprinkling a little over the top.</p>


<h3>Bro. Cornforth’s Squash and Sweet Potato Pie</h3>

<p>2 eggs, ½ cup sugar, 1 pt. dry mashed squash and sweet potato
(½ potato, ⅔ squash), 1 qt. milk, salt. No other flavor.</p>


<h3>Lemon Squash Pie</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1½ cup nice dry squash</li>
  <li>2⅓ cups water or 2½ of milk</li>
  <li>¾&ndash;1 scant cup sugar</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>¾ teaspn. vanilla</li>

  <li>3 eggs</li>
  <li>3&ndash;5 drops lemon extract</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix as usual, reserving the lemon extract and white of 1 egg for
the meringue. Bake in moderate oven and meringue with the
white of egg beaten not very stiff with 1&ndash;1½ tablespn. sugar and
the lemon extract. (A thick meringue seems out of place on a
squash pie.) If preferred, 1 or 2 of the whites may be beaten
stiff, flavored and stirred into the pie before it is baked. ½&ndash;¾
cup soup cracker crumbs may be used instead of eggs.</p>


<h3>Pumpkin Pies</h3>

<p><i>Suggestions</i>&mdash;Select a dark, rich-colored pumpkin with deep
indentations and thick meat. Some of the small sugar pumpkins
are very nice.</p>

<p>Good pies cannot be made out of coarse-grained, watery pumpkins.</p>

<p>Baked pumpkin makes richer pies than stewed, with less work.
<a id="Page_367" class="pagenum" title="367"> </a>
To bake, cut or saw a pumpkin into halves, and if large, cut into
quarters; place on a large tin and turn another over it; bake
until tender.</p>

<p>To boil, cut in strips, remove fibrous portion from center, cut
in pieces and put over the fire in some thick-bottomed utensil,
either copper, re-tinned, or iron; add just enough water to keep
it from burning and simmer slowly, stirring often, for several
hours until the pumpkin becomes a rich brown and is well dried
out. Rub through colander while hot.</p>

<p>Pumpkin may be steamed in strips, unpeeled, but is not so rich.</p>

<p>The question of peeling is an open one; many claim that the
rind gives a richer flavor to the pies as well as a darker color,
while others fear it may give a strong flavor.</p>

<p>“The real genuine old-fashioned golden-brown pumpkin pie
our great-grandmothers prided themselves on” is made without
eggs.</p>

<p>Long, slow baking is necessary to the perfection of pumpkin
pies.</p>

<p>Cover crust of pies with a circle of paper if in danger of becoming
too brown.</p>

<p>Meringued patty pan pies or tartlets are very dainty and nice.</p>

<p>The addition of ¼ cup of date pulp (½ cup of dates steamed
and rubbed through the colander) to the filling for each pie gives
a more old-fashioned flavor, without harmful condiments.</p>


<h4>Pumpkin Pies Without Eggs&mdash;3 pies</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1¼ qt. rich, dark, dry pumpkin</li>
  <li>3 pts. rich milk</li>
  <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
  <li>¼ cup molasses</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>1½ tablespns. browned flour No.&nbsp;3 or 3&ndash;6 tablespns. browned flour No.&nbsp;2</li>
</ul>

<p>Bake in not too rich crust in moderate oven 1½ hour. Use 1
cupful more of pumpkin if not dry, and if necessary, 1½ level
tablespn. of white flour.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_368" class="pagenum" title="368"> </a>
Pumpkin Pies with Eggs&mdash;3 very large pies</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. rich dark dry pumpkin</li>
  <li>2 qts. milk</li>
  <li>6 eggs</li>
  <li>1&ndash;1½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>or ¾ cup sugar and ¼ cup molasses</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>1½ tablespn. browned flour No.&nbsp;3 or 3&ndash;6 tablespns. browned flour No.&nbsp;2</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat whites and yolks of eggs separate; bake slowly until firm
in center. Use 1¼ qt. of pumpkin if not dry, and 1¾ qt. only
of milk. May use a little less pumpkin when adding dates.</p>


<h4>★ One Pumpkin Pie</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1¾ cup moderately dry pumpkin</li>
  <li>½ tablespn. browned flour No.&nbsp;3, or</li>
  <li>1&ndash;2 tablespns. browned flour No.&nbsp;2</li>
  <li>½ level tablespn. white flour</li>
  <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. molasses</li>
  <li>½ level teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>2⅓ cups milk</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
</ul>

<p>Bake in moderate oven. ⅓ nice winter squash improves the
pie.</p>

<p>One recipe says ¼ teaspn. ground coriander seed. Some of
the best pies have no added flavoring.</p>

<p>1 teaspn. of butter or 1 or 2 tablespns. of thick cream in the
filling will give a gloss to the surface.</p>

<p>Some prefer flour, a little granella or a few zwieback crumbs
to eggs, for thickening when the pumpkin is not very thick.</p>


<h4>Grated Pumpkin Pie</h4>

<p>Grate pumpkin without peeling. If moist, put into a piece of
cheese cloth and squeeze out the water; for each pie take:</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup pumpkin</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. molasses</li>
  <li>1 or 2 tablespns. sugar</li>
  <li>pinch of salt</li>
  <li>½ tablespn. browned flour No.&nbsp;3 or 1&ndash;2 of No.&nbsp;2</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. ground coriander, or ¼ level teaspn. ground anise seed, or 1 teaspn. vanilla, or no flavoring</li>
  <li>small piece of butter</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. cracker or zwieback crumbs</li>
  <li>1½&ndash;2 cups milk</li>
</ul>

<p>Sprinkle top with cocoanut or not. Bake thoroughly.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_369" class="pagenum" title="369"> </a>

  <li>1 level tablespn. white flour</li>
  <li>⅓ cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. molasses</li>
  <li>½ level teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>2⅓ cups milk</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>dust with coriander</li>
</ul>

<p>Or, use 3 tablespns. only of carrot, omit browned flour and
flavor with lemon or vanilla.</p>


<h3>Turnip Pie</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1½&ndash;2 cups mashed turnip</li>
  <li>⅓&ndash;½ cup brown sugar</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. molasses</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. melted butter</li>
  <li>2 eggs (or 1 egg and scant ¼ cup of granella)</li>
  <li>½&ndash;1 tablespn. browned flour No.&nbsp;3</li>
  <li>2 teaspns. ground coriander seed</li>
  <li>2 cups milk</li>
  <li>salt</li>

<p>The turnip should be the sweet Swedish turnip.</p>




<h2 id="CAKES"><a id="Page_370" class="pagenum" title="370"> </a>
CAKES</h2>


<p>The fact that soda and cream of tartar are the ingredients of
the best baking powders is well understood.</p>

<p>Dr. Lillis Wood Starr says: “Cream of tartar belongs to the
same class with soda. Soda is bi-carbonate of sodium; cream of
tartar is bi-tartrate of potassium. Sodium, potassium and calcium
(lime) all belong to the same group of metals and are injurious
to the tissues of our bodies.”</p>

<p>Dr. Lauretta Kress&mdash;“Cream of tartar or Potassium Bi-tartrate
is a gastro-intestinal irritant like soda. By combining cream of
tartar and soda, we have Rochelle salts. If needed as a cathartic,
they are better given as such on an empty stomach; then
the system quickly gets rid of them. If taken in food they are
retained longer and become more irritating.”</p>

<p>“Sugar when largely used is more injurious than meat.”</p>

<p>Cake at its best is not to be recommended, but for those who
have not yet discarded it, we give a variety of recipes for cakes
without baking powder or soda: there are some, also, without
eggs.</p>

<p>When a few more eggs are used in a cake than would be required
with chemicals, remember that less of the nitrogenous
is necessary in other dishes: also, that the health of your
family is of the first importance and it would be better not to
give them any cake at all than that which will poison their
systems.</p>


<h3>Suggestions</h3>

<p>Use pastry flour for all cakes; and since different brands even
of pastry flour differ, it is best to use the same brand when you
find a good one and become accustomed to it.</p>

<p>Sift flour once before measuring; and from 3&ndash;5 times for angel
<a id="Page_371" class="pagenum" title="371"> </a>
and other sponge cakes after measuring. The best way to sift
flour several times is to lay down two pieces of large letter or
Manila paper and to sift the flour first on to one and then
on to the other.</p>

<p>All measurements have the sifted flour laid lightly into the
cup with a spoon. If the cup is shaken or knocked on the side
with the spoon there will be too much flour.</p>

<p>Skimmed milk and oil may be used in cakes and the cream
saved for other purposes.</p>

<p>At great altitude, more flour and less shortening and sugar will
be required in cakes.</p>

<p>In recipes calling for cream of tarter, use lemon juice in the
proportion of 1 tablespn. or more to each teaspoon of cream of
tartar. A larger quantity of lemon juice makes the cake more
tender.</p>

<p>2 whites of eggs are said to equal 1 rounded teaspn. of baking
powder, for lightness.</p>

<p>Boil molasses or syrup before using in cakes.</p>

<p>Half oil instead of all butter may be used in nearly all cakes,
and in some cases, all oil is better. Use salt with oil.</p>

<p>It is usually thought important to cream butter and sugar well
together, but one professional cake-maker told me that cakes
were lighter when the butter and sugar were just mixed.</p>

<p>Always add a little of the flour for cakes to the creamed butter
or sugar and butter, before adding eggs, milk or other liquids.</p>

<p>Saffron is used for both color and flavor: a very small quantity
only, is required of the imported for a deep color.</p>

<p>For variety, thin slices of sweet prunes or dates are nice in
place of other fruits in cakes.</p>

<p>Round tube pans bake cake the most evenly, Turk’s head
molds being the best of all.</p>

<p>Do not oil the tins, for cakes without shortening.</p>

<p><a id="Page_372" class="pagenum" title="372"> </a>
For cakes with shortening, oil the tins and sprinkle flour over,
shaking off all flour that is loose; or, line tins with well oiled
paper.</p>

<p>Some recommend dipping angel cake pans into cold water and
filling while wet; then the cake falls out white when cold, leaving
the crust sticking to the mold.</p>

<p>Always beat whites of eggs on a platter or in a large cake bowl
or “bombe” with a whip, not with a revolving beater.</p>

<p>Chop and fold, never stir, the whites into cake, the flour also.</p>

<p>Have all ingredients and utensils for sponge cake cold, and if
possible, put it together in a cold room.</p>

<p>For sponge cakes, follow directions for putting nut and citron
cake together, or the hot water way following sponge layer cake.</p>

<p>Bake sponge cakes very slowly and evenly in an oven that
bakes well from the bottom. They will retain their lightness
better if carefully inverted in the tin after baking and left in
that position until cool.</p>

<p>Bake cakes with shortening in a moderate oven.</p>

<p>Cool all cakes slowly. One colored cook told me that she
always set her cakes on the stove hearth for a little while after
taking them out of the oven. Of course they should be handled
carefully.</p>

<p>Set warm layer and other cakes on a cloth wrung out of cold
water and they will quickly loosen from the pan.</p>

<p>Loaf or layer cakes may be set in ice box in tins for 2 hrs.
before baking.</p>

<p>3 or 4 rose geranium leaves laid in the bottom of the tin before
the batter is poured in will flavor cake with rose, or the
leaves may be laid between layers after baking, while cooling.
If the loaf is one that will bear removing from the tin while
warm, lay it on some of the leaves.</p>

<p>Cakes may be steamed instead of baked&mdash;sponge cakes 1 hour,
<a id="Page_373" class="pagenum" title="373"> </a>
fruit cakes longer. One recipe for fruit cake says, steam 4 hours
and bake 1 hour. Use your judgment.</p>

<p>Sponge cakes&mdash;angel and others, are supposed to be broken
apart with 2 forks, not cut.</p>

<p>If loaves of cake that are to be covered with whipped cream
are cut before the cream is put on, the cake will look smooth
and nice and the pieces will come out more neatly.</p>

<p>Cakes made with yeast require to be kept a little warmer than
bread (unless you keep bread too warm), and flour, fruit and all
ingredients should be warm when added.</p>


<h3>★ Nut and Citron Cake</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>3 large or 4 small eggs</li>
  <li>1 scant cup granulated sugar</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. lemon juice</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. ice water</li>
  <li>⅔&ndash;¾ cup Brazil nut, almond, pecan or shell-bark meal</li>
  <li>½ cup (¼ lb.) fine chopped or ground citron</li>
  <li>1 cup pastry flour</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Have all the ingredients as nearly ice cold as possible; sift the
sugar, sift the flour twice and leave it in the sifter; beat the yolks
of the eggs in a cake bowl with a revolving egg-beater (a large
one if you have it), adding sugar gradually. When stiff, add part
of the water and more sugar; beat, add more water, sugar and
half the lemon juice, beating, until all the sugar is in.</p>

<p>Stir into this mixture half the nut meal, a pinch of salt and
the citron. Rest the egg beater on a quart measure (or some
dish of the required height) by the side of the bowl, and let it
drain into the bowl while beating the whites of the eggs. It
will drain much cleaner than it could be scraped, besides saving
the time. Beat the whites of the eggs to a moderately stiff
froth, add the remaining half tablespn. of lemon juice and whip
till dry and feathery; let them stand a moment, then slide onto
the yolk mixture; sprinkle part of the nut meal over them and
sift on a little flour; chop in lightly, dipping from the bottom
with a large thin spoon three times; add more meal and flour;
chop; continue this until the flour is all in. Take care not to
<a id="Page_374" class="pagenum" title="374"> </a>
mix too much; the mixture must not get soft. Put into pan at
once and bake slowly until the cake stops singing, or does not
stick to a broom splint. Bake 1½ hours, according to the
heat of the oven. The fine particles of citron give an unusually
delightful flavor to the cake. Preserved orange peel, ground,
may be used sometimes; or fine cut raisins or dried blueberries.</p>

  <li>2 cups flour</li>
  <li>flavoring</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream butter and sugar; add flavoring and a little of the flour,
then the beaten yolks; beat well. Slide the stiffly-beaten whites
on to this mixture, sift flour over gradually and chop together as
for nut and citron cake; bake in moderate oven in 3 medium
sized layers; sift a little sugar over one layer before baking,
sometimes, to make a crust for the top. If possible, set in ice
box for an hour before baking.</p>

<h3>★ Silver Cake</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 lb. (2 cups and 3 tablespns.) sugar</li>
  <li>¾ lb. (3⅛&ndash;3½ cups) flour</li>
  <li>6 oz. (¾ cup soft) butter</li>
  <li>rose flavor</li>
  <li>1½ cup citron or prunes in slices</li>
  <li>whites of 14 eggs</li>

<h3>★ Scotch Short Bread&mdash;no eggs</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½ cup butter</li>
  <li>½ cup granulated or brown, or slightly rounded ½ cup powdered sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. caraway seed or not</li>
  <li>2 cups flour</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream butter, add sugar and flour mixed, seeds also if used.
A little of the flour may be saved for rolling.</p>

<p>Roll to about 1 in. thick, of the shape to fit your tin; crinkle
the edges, press them with a fork or cut with pastry jagger, slide
on to tin, prick lightly with fork and bake in a slow oven for 1
hour; or, roll ½ in. thick and bake ½ hour only. The cake is
sometimes creased in squares before baking, or the dough may
be cut in round cakes and the edges crinkled.</p>

<p>The cake is better with oil and ¼ teaspn. of salt in place of
butter. One cup of sugar is sometimes used with ½ cup of butter
or oil, and again, 1 cup of butter or oil with ½ cup of sugar,
but the cake is very nice with the proportions given. By
some, brown sugar is considered most suitable.</p>

  <li>3 level tablespns. butter</li>
  <li>½ cup molasses</li>
  <li>½ cup sugar, brown or white</li>

<h3>★ Molasses Bread or Hard Molasses Cake&mdash;no eggs</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1¾ qt. (7 cups) flour</li>
  <li>1 cup butter (part oil)</li>

put into flat tins about 1 in. deep, wash over with milk and bake
in a very slow oven.</p>

<p>When done, wrap or cover with damp cloths and keep at least
4 days before using. If necessary, moisten the cloths again,
and perhaps again. The cakes will be hard and dry when taken
from the oven, but keeping them for a few days in damp (not
wet) cloths makes them nice and tender. Grated orange peel
and vanilla, together or separate, may be used for flavoring;
but the delicate flavor of anise is especially agreeable.</p>

<p>By weight, the ingredients are 1½ lb. pastry flour, ½ lb.
butter, ½ lb. brown sugar, ⅞ lb. molasses.</p>


<h3>YEAST CAKES</h3>

  <li>2 cups fine cut or ground citron</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. lemon extract</li>
</ul>

<p>⅔&ndash;1 cake compressed yeast dissolved in a very little water,
with sugar, may be used instead of soft yeast, and 1 extra
tablespn. of water added to the sponge.</p>

<p>Make a sponge at night of the milk (just warm), yeast and 4½
cups of flour, and in the morning add the cup of warm saffron
water. Cream the butter and sugar with a little flour, add the
sponge gradually, mixing and beating, then the remainder of the
flour warm (except a little which has been used to dust the fruit),
beat well, add the extract and warmed, floured fruit, mix and
<a id="Page_380" class="pagenum" title="380"> </a>
pour into 3 good sized paper lined cake pans. Let stand until
bubbles appear in the batter, usually 2&ndash;3 hrs. with soft yeast;
not so long, perhaps, with compressed; when light, put into
a slow oven; let cakes come up slowly and bake very moderately
until they stop singing, 1½&ndash;2 hrs., depending upon the heat of
the oven, but they must bake slowly.</p>

<p>When cake is started in the morning, 6 tablespns. of soft, or
a whole cake of compressed yeast may be used. The quantity
of flour may need to be varied a little according to the brand.</p>

the last divide into 2 parts, add the citron and rose to one, and
the cocoanut and vanilla to the other. The loaves will not be
very large.</p>


<h3>White Fruit Cake&mdash;no eggs</h3>

  <li>a pinch of salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. vanilla</li>
</ul>

<p>Sift 2 or 3 cups of sugar twice; measure out 1 cup; sift a sifter
of flour 4 times; measure out 1 cup and mix it with the cup of
sugar; put both in the sifter and sift once, return to the sifter
and set in cold place; separate the eggs, putting the whites into
the dish in which they are to be beaten and set them in a cold
place for 15&ndash;20 m.<!--TN: added period-->; when cool, add the salt to the eggs and begin
beating with a long slow stroke, gradually increasing the velocity
until the eggs begin to stiffen, then pour the lemon juice over
and beat more rapidly for a time; continue beating until whites
are stiff and feathery, then add flavoring; sift flour and sugar
mixture over gradually, chopping and folding it in carefully;
when all is in, drop by spoonfuls evenly into the pan and bake
in slow oven 35&ndash;50 m., testing with broom straw. When done,
turn the pan upside down with the sides resting on two saucers
(unless you have the pans with projections for that purpose), so
that a current of air will pass under and over the cake.</p>


<h3>Tri-Colored Layer Cake</h3>

<p>Angel cake&mdash;½ white flavored with vanilla; ½ pink flavored
with rose, 3 or 4 large layers. Other layers, of sponge layer cake
lemon flavored, or some nice light brown cake such as molasses
<a id="Page_386" class="pagenum" title="386"> </a>
sugar cake or sponge layer cake with part browned flour. Filling
of raisin dressing.</p>


<h3>Miss Lubey’s Cream Puffs. 1 doz.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 large cup boiling water</li>
  <li>½ cup butter or oil</li>
  <li>1 cup pastry flour</li>
  <li>3 eggs</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Add dry flour all at once to boiling water and butter; stir
quickly over the fire until mixture forms a ball which leaves the
pan; remove from fire and stir till partly cool; add beaten yolks
of eggs, part at a time, beating well, then slightly beaten whites;
beat; set in cold place, covered, for 1 hr. or more; drop by spoonfuls
about 2 in. apart on oiled and floured tin, flatten with brush
or fingers dipped in milk (may leave without shaping); have oven
rather quick at first, then slower until there is no “singing”.
Puffs are light weight when done. They will keep for several
days. Reheat before filling. To fill, cut open at the side with
shears.</p>

<p>The butter and flour may be creamed together first, and the
boiling water poured over, then the whole cooked as before.</p>

<div class="title"><i>Cream</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. milk</li>
  <li>½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. flour</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. vanilla</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix sugar and flour, pour boiling milk over, boil up well; pour
over beaten eggs, return to fire until just creamy, not boiling,
cool; add salt and flavoring.</p>

<p>If cream is preferred thicker, use ½ cup of flour and cook in
double boiler 15 m. before adding the eggs.</p>

<p>Whipped cream may be used for the filling, but does not harmonize
as well with the shells.</p>

<p>These shells are sometimes used for trumese and celery salad,
or for creamed meat dishes.</p>

<p>Dainty little puffs filled with different creams may be used for
garnishes for desserts, or piled on fancy plates for cakes.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_387" class="pagenum" title="387"> </a>
Additions to Cookies and Small Cakes</h3>

<p>Caraway or anise seeds, ground coriander or anise seed; chopped
shelled nuts; grated or shredded cocoanut; grated orange or
lemon rind; English currants; fine cut or ground raisins, citron,
figs and dates; sometimes a raisin or half a blanched almond or
half of a pecan or hickory nut meat in the center of each.</p>


<h3>Suggestive Combinations</h3>

<p>Coriander, English currants and English walnuts; raisins in
molasses cookies; almonds chopped without blanching, and raisins;
almonds same, and caraway or ground coriander seed.</p>

<p>Graham flour cookies with English currants; 1 part raisins and
⅓ part each of nuts, cocoanut and citron, with or without vanilla
or lemon.</p>

<p>All cooky dough should be set in a cold place for 2 hrs. or
longer before rolling out. Roll out in cool room on well floured
board. Cut the cakes all out, put on tins and set in cold place
before beginning to bake them as the baking will require all one’s
attention.</p>

<p>Very thin dough may be cut oblong, round or in any desired
shape and some of the following fillings placed between each
two pieces before they are baked&mdash;</p>

<p>Ground or mashed dates or figs rolled thin and cut with the
same cutter that the dough was cut with; raspberry or other
fruit jams and jellies or orange marmalade, also some of the suitable
cake fillings.</p>

<p>It may sometimes be more convenient to cut the dough into
strips 4 in. wide, spread half the width with the fruit, fold the
other half over, pinch down the edge and cut into 3 in. lengths.</p>

<p>Tops of cookies may sometimes be brushed with white of egg
and water or with syrup of ½ cup each sugar and water boiled
together; or, sprinkled with sugar, coriander, chopped nuts or
suitable fruits.</p>

<p>Instead of sprinkling cookies with different materials, brush
<a id="Page_388" class="pagenum" title="388"> </a>
the tops with milk and turn them on to any preparation or mixture
desired.</p>

<p>Grated and sifted maple sugar may be used in place of other
sugar in cookies by using a somewhat smaller quantity.</p>

<p>Oil and flour pans for baking cookies.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to bake cookies on the bottom of inverted
dripping pans. This prevents them from burning on the bottom
and it is easier to remove them from the tins.</p>


<h3>★ Rich Small Cakes&mdash;Cookies</h3>

<div class="subtitle">
(<i>From an old recipe book of my auntie’s, published in 1846</i>)
</div>

<ul class="ingredients">

Bake in oven which is moderately hot at first, so cakes will not
spread. Be careful not to burn.</p>

<p>A little more flour may be used if preferred, also half oil instead
of all butter, and brown sugar instead of granulated.</p>

<p>For <i>Jumbles</i>, break off pieces of dough the size of a walnut
and make into rings by rolling out rolls as large as the finger and
joining the ends; or, cut in rings; dust with sugar.</p>

<h3>★ Cream Cookies</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 cup thin cream</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. vanilla</li>
  <li>yolks of 3 eggs</li>
  <li>scant ¾ cup butter and oil half and half</li>
  <li>about 4½ cups flour</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="Page_389" class="pagenum" title="389"> </a>
Cream butter and sugar, stir in a little flour, add beaten yolks,
beat well, then add the cream gradually with the flavoring, and
lastly, all of the flour. Handle after mixing the same as rich
small cakes. Fruits, nuts or seeds maybe added. These cookies
will keep almost indefinitely.</p>


<h3>Lunch Cakes</h3>

<p>Take ½ the sugar and a little more flour in rich small cakes,
or cream cookies, and roll to ½ or 1 in. in thickness. Cut of
the size to fit tins, crinkle edges or press with fork, crease in
squares and bake in moderate oven. Caraway or other flavoring
may be used. Chopped nuts, a little sugar and ground or shredded
citron may be mixed on a board or flat pan and one side of the
cakes pressed into the mixture before baking. Set in cold place
before rolling out.</p>


<h3>Anise Wafers, or German Christmas Cakes</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½ cup butter</li>
  <li>1 cup sugar</li>
  <li>3 eggs</li>

<p>Cream butter, add sugar and a little flour, with seeds, then
the yolks of the eggs, one at a time, and the stiffly-beaten whites,
with flour, folding together lightly; knead in flour for soft dough,
cover and set in cold place; roll rather thin, cut cakes about the
size of a half dollar.</p>


<h3>Sour Cream Cookies&mdash;no soda</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 cup thick sour cream</li>
  <li>yolks 3 eggs</li>
  <li>scant ¾ cup oil or butter</li>

<p>Mix lightly, set in cold place, roll rather thin.</p>


<h3>Honey Wafers</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup honey boiled and cooled</li>
  <li>⅔ cup butter</li>
  <li>2 small eggs or 1 large one</li>
  <li>pinch salt</li>
  <li>5 cups flour</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream butter with a little flour, add beaten egg and honey,
then remainder of flour.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_390" class="pagenum" title="390"> </a>
Molasses Cookies</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>¾ cup molasses</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>1 cup butter</li>
  <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
  <li>½&ndash;¾ teaspn. lemon extract</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. browned flour</li>
  <li>about 3½ cups pastry flour</li>
</ul>

<p>Heat molasses to boiling and pour slowly, stirring, over well
beaten eggs; cool; cream butter and sugar, stir in browned flour
mixed with a little of the white flour, add flavoring with eggs
and molasses, then the remainder of the flour or enough to make
a not too soft dough. Set in cold place and roll out the same
as small cakes. Care must be taken in baking, as molasses
burns easily.</p>

<p>Or, boil and cool molasses, cream butter and sugar, add beaten
eggs, a little flour, then molasses gradually, beating well, and
finally, the flour.</p>

<p>Browned flour may be omitted and a few drops of rose extract
used in flavoring.</p>


<h3>★ Molasses Cakes&mdash;no eggs</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1¼ cup oil or butter</li>
  <li>2 cups molasses</li>
  <li>orange or lemon rind or</li>
  <li>coriander, anise, rose or vanilla flavoring</li>
  <li>pastry flour</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream butter with a little flour, add molasses which has been
boiled and cooled, with flavoring, and flour for stiff dough, about
2¼ qts. Mix as little as possible, cover and set in cold place
for several hours. Shape into small thick cakes, or, roll about
½ in. thick, prick with fork or crease and cut into small cakes.
Bake in moderate oven. Remove from tins as soon as baked.</p>

<p>With nice flavored molasses, no other flavoring is necessary.
More shortening may be used.</p>


<h3>★ Molasses Snaps&mdash;no eggs</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½ cup oil or butter, or half of each</li>
  <li>1 cup sugar</li>
  <li>2 cups flour</li>
  <li>2 cups molasses</li>
  <li>flavoring</li>
  <li>more flour</li>
</ul>

<p>Cream butter, sugar and the 2 cups of flour, pour hot molasses
<a id="Page_391" class="pagenum" title="391"> </a>
over, add flavoring and flour for stiff dough, perhaps about 6 cups;
press together lightly, set in cold place for several hours; roll
thin, bake in moderately quick oven and remove from tins at
once. These cakes will be brittle when first made and will grow
softer with time. One cup of butter may be used for richer cakes.</p>


<h3>Nut Wafers</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup chopped English walnut, pecan or hickory nut meats</li>
  <li>1 cup dark brown sugar</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>4 level tablespns. flour</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat eggs, add sugar gradually, beating well; then add flour,
salt and nuts. Mix, spread as thin as possible on buttered pans,
set in cold place, bake in quick oven. When nearly cold, cut
into squares.</p>


<h3>Nut Cakes&mdash;Bro. Hurdon</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup chopped nut meats</li>
  <li>1 cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 cup flour</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix, drop on well oiled tins some distance apart, bake. Remove
from tins when taken from the oven.</p>


<h3>Hard Sponge Cakes</h3>

<p>Cream together ¼ cup butter and 1 cup sugar, add 1 well
beaten egg and 1 cup of flour to which has been added a pinch
of salt; stir in 1 cup chopped nut meats; drop in spoonfuls on
buttered tins and flatten or shape a little; bake in moderate oven.</p>


<h3>Risen Doughnuts&mdash;Baked</h3>

<div class="title"><i>Sponge</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup milk</li>
  <li>⅔ cake compressed yeast</li>
  <li>2 cups flour</li>
</ul>

<p>Add dissolved yeast and flour to warm milk, beat well, let rise.</p>

<div class="title"><i>When light</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>5 tablespns. oil or melted butter</li>
  <li>vanilla, lemon, coriander or anise for flavoring</li>
  <li>2&ndash;2½ cups flour</li>
  <li>¼ teaspn. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat oil and sugar together with a little flour, add flavoring,
salt and light sponge, gradually, beating; then enough flour for
<a id="Page_392" class="pagenum" title="392"> </a>
a moderately stiff dough; knead a little and let rise. When well
risen, roll ½ or ¾ in. thick, cut with doughnut cutter and place
on floured, oiled tins some distance apart. Let rise, bake.</p>

<p>Roll in sugar with or without ground coriander seed or chopped
nuts before laying on tins, if desired, or moisten with sugar syrup
or white of egg and water and roll in sugar after baking.</p>

<p>Another half-spoon of oil may be added to sponge, with 1
white and 2 yolks of eggs well beaten, but eggs are not necessary.
If a yellow color is desired, use a little saffron. Mix softer when
eggs are used.</p>


<h3>Risen Doughnuts</h3>

<div class="title"><i>Sponge</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup skimmed milk</li>
  <li>⅔ cake compressed, or</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. soft yeast</li>
  <li>2 cups flour</li>
</ul>

<div class="title"><i>When light</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>3 tablespns. oil or melted butter</li>
  <li>½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>flavouring</li>
  <li>yolk of 1 egg or not</li>
  <li>flour for rather stiff dough</li>
</ul>

<p>Proceed as in baked doughnuts, lay on floured board, cover;
when very light, fry in cooking or olive oil, hot enough for the
cakes to rise to the top almost instantly. Turn at once with a
fork. ⅓ of a cup of oil may be used in the cakes and 1 whole
well beaten egg.</p>

<p>Our grandmothers’ twisted doughnuts are dear to all our hearts.</p>

<p>Sometimes roll the dough thin, cut with biscuit cutter and put
a teaspoonful of some jelly or jam on one side, fold the other
side over, having moistened the edges, press well together, fry
when light, roll in sugar. Baked doughnuts may be prepared
the same.</p>


<h3>Crullers</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>⅓&ndash;½ cup butter</li>
  <li>⅓&ndash;½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>3 eggs (separate if desired)</li>
  <li>flour for soft dough</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix, chill, roll thin, cut in strips 3½ in. long and 2 in. wade;
cut 2 slits in each piece and give each strip of dough a twist.
<a id="Page_393" class="pagenum" title="393"> </a>
Fry in oil or bake in oven. When to be fried, use the smaller
quantity of butter and sugar.</p>

<p>Crullers may have 4 incisions made lengthwise to within ⅓ of
an in. of each end. To fry, take up the second and fourth strips
and let the others separate in the middle from those in the hand
as you drop them into the hot oil. For baking, it is better to
twist the strips.</p>


<h3>Fried Cakes</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup milk</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
  <li>salt, flour</li>
  <li>3 tablespns. oil or melted butter</li>
</ul>

<p>Add sugar and yolks of eggs to cold milk, agitate with wire
batter whip until full of bubbles, sprinkle flour in gradually,
keeping up the agitating motion. When the batter is quite stiff,
beat in the oil gradually, and chop in the stiffly-beaten whites
of eggs. Add flour for rather stiff dough and set in cold place
for 2 hrs. or longer. Shape and fry the same as risen doughnuts.</p>


<h3 id="ICINGS_AND_FILLINGS">ICINGS AND FILLINGS FOR CAKES</h3>

<p>Starch, which is changed into sugar in the process of digestion,
and cane sugar, form so large a part of all cakes as to furnish in
themselves an excess of that element; so why should we put a
coating of almost solid sugar over the outside? Certainly not for
hygienic reasons. If a cake is well baked, the icing only hides
its beauty, and the excessive sweetness destroys the flavors of
the finest cake. Let us not use it. Protest and recipes are
both given.</p>

<p>Instead of icing, sometimes sift granulated, brown or powdered
sugar over the top of the loaf of cake, or over one layer to be
used for the top, before baking.</p>

<p>Glaze the top of molasses cookies or cakes before baking with
a mixture of 1 yolk of egg and 2 tablespns. of milk.</p>

<p>Sprinkle half a cup of chopped or ground blanched almonds
or other nuts over the top of the cake just before it goes into
<a id="Page_394" class="pagenum" title="394"> </a>
the oven, and cover the cake until nearly done to prevent
browning the nuts.</p>

<p>The tops of cakes may be brushed after baking with equal parts
of molasses and milk mixed.</p>

<h4>Water Icing</h4>

<p>The simplest of icings is granulated, powdered or xxxx confectioner’s
sugar formed into a paste so that it will run just smooth,
by the addition of hot or cold water. That made from granulated
sugar must be made with hot water and be pretty stiff. It
takes longer to dry and is more likely to run; that from powdered
sugar is also quite likely to run. The icing made from confectioner’s
sugar is the most satisfactory. It is usually made with
cold water, but one authority recommends hot water very positively.</p>

<p>One recipe for granulated sugar frosting is&mdash;</p>

<p>1 cup sugar, 1 tablespn. boiling water, beat until it will spread.</p>

<h4>Fruit Juice Icing</h4>

<p>Stir rolled and sifted confectioner’s sugar into any desired
fruit juice until of the right consistency to spread; use a knife
dipped in cold water to smooth the icing; 1&ndash;1½ tablespn. of
liquid will be enough for the top of a medium sized loaf of cake.</p>

<p>If you have never made such an icing, you will be surprised to
see how much sugar a little liquid will take. More icing is quickly
made if you do not have enough.</p>

<p>When juices of different fruits are used in their season, the
top of the cake may be decorated with the fruit whole, in halves
or in slices. For instance, slices from the heart of strawberries,
or, halves of red raspberries. The fruit may also be placed between
the layers of the cake.</p>

<h4>Cream Icing</h4>

<p>Stir confectioner’s sugar into cream, plain or whipped, for
both filling and icing.</p>

<p>If you have a little of these icings left over, cover it and set
<a id="Page_395" class="pagenum" title="395"> </a>
in a cold place, and add more liquid and sugar to it the next time.</p>

<h4>White of Egg Icing&mdash;Miss Stokes</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>white of 1 egg</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. ice water</li>
  <li>speck of salt</li>
  <li>1 cup confectioner’s sugar</li>
  <li>flavoring</li>
</ul>

<p>Beat white of egg with water, flavoring and salt to a stiff dry
froth; add sugar until of the right consistency to spread, if too
stiff, add quickly 1 teaspn. of cream or a few drops of water.</p>

<p>The icing is sometimes made by mixing the water and egg
without beating and stirring the sugar in, making a smoother
and more tender frosting. May use powdered sugar.</p>

<h4>White of Egg Icing with Lemon Juice</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>white of 1 egg</li>
  <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. lemon juice</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. vanilla</li>
</ul>

<p>Put the white of egg into a bowl and add the sugar by degrees,
beating; when the sugar is all in, add lemon juice and vanilla.</p>

<h4>Golden Icing</h4>

<p>Yolks of 2 or 3 eggs and powdered sugar to make stiff enough
to spread, about 1 cupful for 3 yolks; vanilla or orange flavoring
or both. Beat until thick and creamy.</p>

<p>For an orange cake, use the juice and grated rind of a small
orange to 3 yolks with the powdered sugar, and use for filling
and icing. Sections of orange may be laid on top. Confectioner’s
sugar may be used.</p>

<h4>★ Butter Frosting&mdash;almost like whipped cream</h4>

<p>Work together 1 cup confectioner’s sugar and 1 level tablespn.
of butter. Flavor with vanilla. Add 1¼&ndash;1½ tablespn. of milk.
Beat well.</p>

<h4>Jelly Icing</h4>

<p>Beat a glass of jelly, a little at a time, into the whites of 2
eggs. If the jelly is very tart, use 2&ndash;3 tablespns. powdered sugar.
Prepare the icing some little time before it is to be used and set
<a id="Page_396" class="pagenum" title="396"> </a>
on ice. Elder-berry jelly gives a delightful flavor and beautiful
color. Quince is also nice.</p>

<h4>Boiled Icing</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
  <li>⅓ cup water</li>
  <li>white of 1 egg</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. vanilla, or the proper proportion of any desired flavoring</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir sugar and water together over the fire until sugar is dissolved,
then boil without stirring until the syrup will spin in
threads when dropped from the tines of a fork, or until a hard
ball is formed when dropped into cold water. Pour slowly over
the stiffly-beaten white of egg, beating briskly, until stiff enough
to spread. If the icing gets too stiff, set over hot water or thin
with a trifle of lemon or other fruit juice, or hot water. ½&ndash;1
teaspn. of lemon juice added to the white of egg when about
half beaten will make the icing more creamy. Some beat the
white of egg slightly, only.</p>

<p>2 or 3 whites may be used with this quantity of syrup. One
writes that she turns her syrup on to a platter and allows it to
become perfectly cold before beating in the eggs, and she thinks
it is much smoother and nicer.</p>

<p>One combination of flavors is, ¼ teaspn. each vanilla, orange
and strawberry, or 1 or 2 drops of rose in place of strawberry.</p>

<p>Bro. Cornforth’s directions are excellent: “Boil the sugar and
water till it threads well, not just till it begins to thread; then
set the dish off the stove and cover tight while you beat the
whites stiff; then pour the hot syrup in a small stream into the
whites, beating continuously; beat till it becomes cool enough
to spread on the cake.”</p>

<h4>Boiled Milk Icing&mdash;no egg</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
  <li>4 tablespns. milk, with or</li>
  <li>without a little butter</li>
  <li>or 1½ cup sugar and ½ cup milk</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil 5 m., or until syrup stiffens in cold water; stir until thick
enough to spread.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_397" class="pagenum" title="397"> </a>
Caramel Icing&mdash;no egg</h4>

<p>1½ cup brown sugar, ½ cup cream. Boil until syrup stiffens
when dropped in water. Substitute ⅔ cup sour cream for sweet,
with brown or granulated sugar.</p>


<h4>Boiled Maple Icing&mdash;no egg</h4>

<p>Add ¾ cup sweet cream to 2 cups rolled or grated maple sugar.
Boil slowly until mixture will thread. Cool about half, stir in
½ cup chopped English walnut meats, beat until creamy, and
spread over cake.</p>

<p>Half granulated sugar may be used, and ½ cup of milk with
a little butter substituted for the cream.</p>


<h4>Maple Syrup Icing and Filling</h4>

<p>Boil ¾&ndash;1 cup of maple syrup until it will form a soft ball in
cold water. Pour over beaten white of egg. Beat until stiff
enough to spread. If desired, stir in ½ cup of rolled butternut
meats just before spreading on the cake. The syrup may be
boiled until it threads.</p>


<h4>Whipped Cream</h4>

<p>Flavored with vanilla is delightful, of course, on the top of
thin loaves of cake cut in squares. Or, for filling, with chopped,
blanched almonds, dry, fine-cut stewed prunes, or slices of banana.</p>

<p>Molasses cake baked in layers, with whipped cream between
the layers and over the top, with or without a sprinkling of grated
cocoanut, is considered a great treat in some households.</p>


<h4>Cocoanut Cream</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup cream, whipped.</li>
  <li>⅓ cup sugar</li>
  <li>1½ cup fresh grated cocoanut</li>
</ul>

<p>Two layers and on top of cake, with cocoanut sprinkled
over top. Some additional flavoring if desired.</p>


<h4>Butternut Filling</h4>

<p>1 cup sweet cream, ½&ndash;¾ cup sugar and 1 cup rolled butternut
meats, mixed without whipping cream. Flavoring if desired.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_398" class="pagenum" title="398"> </a>
★ Sour Cream Filling</h4>

<p>Before I gave up cake I used to think this filling had no equal:</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½ cup thick sour cream</li>
  <li>½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>1½ cup chopped blanched almonds</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. vanilla</li>
</ul>

<p>Whip cream (ice-cold), sugar and vanilla together until just
thick, taking care not to whip too long as sour cream turns to
butter more easily than sweet; add the almonds, spread<!--TN: was 'spreadly'--> quickly
between layers of cake and roughly on top. The nuts may be
sprinkled over the layers of cream instead of being mixed with
it. The white of an egg beaten stiff with part of the sugar is
sometimes added to the whipped cream. Shellbark, English
walnut or rolled butternut meats may be substituted for almonds.</p>


<h4>Creamed Apple</h4>

<p>White of 1 large egg, 1½ cup granulated, powdered or confectioner’s
sugar, 2 or 3 medium sized apples. Peel apples and
grate on to unbeaten white of egg and sugar in large bowl; beat for
20 m.<!--TN: added period-->; or until light and creamy. Lemon, rose or strawberry
may be used if flavoring is desired. Spread between layers and
on top of cold cake. Bananas, peaches and other fruits rubbed
through a fine colander may be used the same as apples.</p>

<p>Steamed quarters of apples may be used.</p>


<h4>Cocoanut Filling</h4>

<p>Spread under and upper sides of layers of warm cake with soft
icing. Sprinkle tops with fresh grated cocoanut and put other
layers on. Use plenty of icing on top of last layer and sprinkle
well with cocoanut.</p>


<h4>Date Filling</h4>

<p>Stone and skin dates after boiling a moment, mash or grind
them, and add water if necessary; spread between layers of cake.
Cover the top of the cake with coffee icing with cream. Chopped
nuts may be mixed with the dates and sprinkled over the
top of the cake.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_399" class="pagenum" title="399"> </a>
Pineapple Filling and Icing</h4>

<p>Chop fresh pineapple and sprinkle with sugar; drain after 3 or
4 hrs; add beaten whites of 2 eggs, ⅔ cup sugar and 1 teaspn.
lemon juice to 1 cup of pineapple and place between layers.
Use some of the juice with confectioner’s sugar for icing the top
and sides of the cake. When using confectioner’s sugar with
pineapple omit whites of eggs.</p>

<p>Drain canned pineapple very dry, chop and add lemon juice
and confectioner’s sugar, when fresh pineapple is not obtainable.</p>

<h2 id="ICE_CREAM_AND_FRUIT_ICES"><a id="Page_402" class="pagenum" title="402"> </a>
ICE CREAM AND FRUIT ICES</h2>


<p>Neither very hot nor very cold foods should be taken at
meals. If foods are too hot, the stomach is debilitated, and if
they are very cold, vitality must be drawn from the system to
warm them before the work of digestion can be carried on; so it
would be better to take ice cream and all ices by themselves
rather than as a dessert.</p>

<p>When ices are served for dessert, they should be eaten very
slowly.</p>

<p>Water ices, sherbets and frozen fruits, without large quantities
of sugar, are invaluable in cases of fever.</p>

<p>I am not going into the subject of ice cream exhaustively for
there are plenty of books on that subject already, but will give
you my own recipe which must be tried to be appreciated.</p>

<p>The little flour in it gives it a smoothness and creaminess with
one third to one half milk equal to all cream without it; and
does not give the disagreeable flavor of corn starch; also, made
by this method, the cream and milk are sterilized.</p>

<p>Try the cream without any flavoring and see how delicious it is.</p>

<p>Use wet snow instead of ice for freezing in the winter. It
works even better and is less trouble.</p>

<p>Beat the cream well with a wooden spoon after removing the
dasher.</p>

<p>Add fruit or nuts to cream when removing the dasher, so that
they will not become hard as they would do if frozen with the
cream.</p>

<p>For freezing, have the ingredients cold. Have the ice very
fine; the finer it is, the better the results. One-third as much
rock salt should be at hand. The ice and salt may be mixed,
or may be put around the freezer in the proportion of 3 inches
of ice to 1 inch of salt.</p>

<p><a id="Page_403" class="pagenum" title="403"> </a>
First, adjust the freezer, having the mixture to be frozen in
the can. Fill not over ⅔ full to allow for expansion. Then
pack with the ice and salt, turning the handle around once in
a while during the operation, to keep the mixture from freezing
to the sides of the can. Have a stick to pound the ice and salt
down well around the can.</p>

<p>Turn slowly at first to make a fine grain, then more rapidly
as the cream thickens.</p>

<p>Before removing the cover to take out the dasher, scrape away
the ice and salt and wipe off the water on the lid and near the
top of the can, so that none can possibly get into the cream.
Beat the cream and replace the cover, with a clean cork in the
top. Drain off a part of the water and repack the can, using
less salt than at first, sometimes not any, so as not to have the
cream too hard. To be at its best, cream should be stiff enough
only to hold its shape. Cover with paper, a blanket or carpet
and let stand to “ripen” for 2 hours or longer. This part is important,
as the flavor and texture are perfected only by standing.</p>

<p>If possible, open the can in an hour and a half and stir the
cream so that the soft center comes to the edge of the can.
Repack and cover the same and let stand for 2 or 3 hours.</p>

<p>Save the salt from the bottom of the freezer to use another
time, and it is a good plan to save a little of the thick salt water
to use instead of the last layer of salt near the top of the can
for the next freezing, as it facilitates the work very much.</p>

<p>In serving, dip the spoon into hot water each time before
putting it into the cream; this, with care, will give a nice shaped
serving.</p>

<p>Pop corn without butter or salt is more suitable to serve with
ice cream than cake.</p>

<p>Sugar syrup gives a finer, smoother and more substantial grain
to frozen fruits, sherbets and water ices than sugar and water,
and they do not melt as quickly when exposed to the air.</p>

<p><a id="Page_404" class="pagenum" title="404"> </a>
Pack all ices the same as creams and let stand the same after
freezing, to become smooth and mellow.</p>

<p>For water ices, do not turn the crank continuously. Turn
slowly and rest between, until the ice becomes quite stiff. This
is the rule, but for a change the freezer may be turned rapidly
and continuously, with a different result.</p>

<p>Stir sherbets constantly. Serve both sherbets and water ices
in glasses.</p>

<p>Vegetable gelatine is an improvement to ices, giving body to
them.</p>

<p>There is a great difference in freezers. Be sure to get a good
one. The construction of the dasher has much to do with the
texture of the cream. Those that freeze the quickest are not
necessarily the best.</p>

<p>Do not buy a small freezer: you can freeze a small quantity
in a large freezer, but you cannot freeze a large quantity in a
small freezer.</p>


<h3>★ The “Laurel” Ice Cream</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2½ pts. heavy cream</li>
  <li>2½ pts. whole milk</li>
  <li>2 cups sugar</li>
  <li>4 or 5 tablespns. pastry flour</li>
</ul>

<p>Stir the flour smooth with some of the cold milk and heat the
remainder of the milk, with the cream and sugar, in a double
boiler and when hot, set over the fire. Let it boil up quickly,
stir in the flour and when boiling all through, return to the double
boiler for a few minutes, beating well. Or, heat the milk and
cream only in the double boiler and pour gradually, stirring,
over the sugar and flour which have been mixed together. Return
to boiler and cook for 10&ndash;15 m. Turn through a fine wire
strainer into a large pan to cool quickly; stir while cooling.</p>

<p>Do not take too large measures of flour.</p>

<p>Any kind of cream may be made from this. Flavor with
vanilla for vanilla cream, or tint pink and flavor with ¾&ndash;1
teaspn. of strawberry extract for strawberry cream, or with a
few drops of rose, for rose cream. Tint green and flavor with
<a id="Page_405" class="pagenum" title="405"> </a>
almond and vanilla for pistachio cream, using only a few drops
of almond to a teaspn. of vanilla. This may have a few shredded
almonds stirred into the frozen cream.</p>

<p>Sometimes sprinkle fresh grated cocoanut over each serving
of cream, or the cocoanut may be stirred in as other flavorings are.</p>

<p>A very pretty cream is one with citron and candied cherries
cut into tiny pieces and added when the dasher is removed.</p>

<p>We make a fruit and nut cream which is liked very much, by
adding well washed English currants, raisins cut in quarters,
citron in small pieces and coarse chopped English walnuts or pecans.
Omit the nuts for a fruit cream.</p>

<p>For coffee cream, steep (not boil) cereal coffee in milk for 10
to 20 m. Strain through a cloth and use as plain milk with the
cream. Flavor with vanilla.</p>

<p>One quart of sweetened, crushed strawberries or raspberries
added to the recipe makes the right proportion for fruit cream.
Drained, finely-shredded or grated pineapple makes a general
favorite in cream.</p>


<h3>Maple Ice Cream</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. genuine maple syrup</li>
  <li>1 qt. heavy cream</li>
  <li>1 qt. light cream</li>
  <li>¾ qt. milk</li>
  <li>7 tablespns. flour</li>
</ul>


<h3>Lemon Ice</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>8&ndash;12 tablespns. lemon juice</li>
  <li>1 orange</li>
  <li>2½ cups sugar</li>
  <li>1 qt. water including the gelatine</li>
  <li>⅛ oz. vegetable gelatine</li>
</ul>

<p>Soak and cook gelatine according to directions (<a href="#Page_335">p.&nbsp;335</a>), add
water to make 1 cup, keep warm; cook sugar and 3 cups of
water together for 5 minutes and strain into the gelatine. Prepare
the lemon and orange juice, and if desired, shave off a little
of the thin yellow rind and let it stand in the juice for a few
minutes, then strain it out. When the gelatine mixture is partially
cooled, add the juice gradually, stirring. The orange may
be omitted.</p>

<p><a id="Page_406" class="pagenum" title="406"> </a>
Or, omit gelatine, boil sugar with 1 qt. of water and when
cool combine with the juice.</p>


<h3>Orange Ice</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. sugar</li>
  <li>1 qt. water</li>
  <li>1 pt. of orange juice</li>
  <li>6&ndash;8 tablespns. lemon juice</li>
  <li>⅛ oz. vegetable gelatine</li>
</ul>

<p>Flavor juice with thin yellow rind of orange and proceed as in
lemon ice, omitting gelatine if preferred.</p>


<h3>Raspberry Ice</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup raspberry juice</li>
  <li>¾ cup sugar (less if juice is already sweetened)</li>
  <li>1 pt. water</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. lemon juice</li>
  <li>1 sixteenth oz. vegetable gelatine, or not</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook sugar and water together and add to prepared gelatine.
When nearly cool, add raspberry juice and stir occasionally until
cool. Freeze.</p>


<h3>Currant and Raspberry Ice</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 cups currant juice</li>
  <li>1 cup raspberry juice</li>
  <li>1 pt. water</li>
  <li>1&ndash;1½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>⅛ oz. gelatine, or not</li>
</ul>

<p>Proceed as in Raspberry Ice.</p>

<p>Use cherry, strawberry, quince, gooseberry, grape or pineapple
for ices, varying the proportion of sugar and water according
to the sweetness of the fruit. Pineapples should be grated
and with the lemon juice added to cold syrup and strained
through a sieve. Pineapple is one of the most delightful ices.</p>


<h3>Mint Ice</h3>

<p>Add fine cut or chopped spearmint to lemon ice mixture just
before freezing, or to orange ice for orange mint ice.</p>


<h3>★ Grape Sherbet</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1½&ndash;1¾ cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 qt. water, scant</li>
  <li>scant ¼ oz. vegetable gelatine</li>
  <li>5&ndash;6 tablespns. lemon juice</li>
  <li>2 cups grape juice</li>
  <li>whites of 2 eggs</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. powdered sugar</li>
</ul>

<p>Flavor the sugar with oil of lemon if desired, and boil with
<a id="Page_407" class="pagenum" title="407"> </a>
the water for 5 m. only. Prepare the gelatine with a scant cup
of water, and add to warm syrup; cool; add lemon and grape
juice, stirring. Put into freezer and stir for 15 m. Beat the
whites of eggs until light but not stiff; add the powdered sugar
and beat 2 m., add to the sherbet in the freezer and finish freezing.
Ripen from 2 to 4 hours. This sherbet is of a beautiful
lavender color when finished.</p>

<p>Substitute other fruit juices for the grape, varying the quantity
of sugar. Red raspberry is better in water ice, as the whites of
the eggs spoil its flavor.</p>


<h3>★ Mint Sherbet</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. water</li>
  <li>1½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>5&ndash;7 good-sized stalks of mint</li>
  <li>⅓&ndash;½ cup lemon juice</li>
  <li>white of 1 large or 2 small eggs</li>
  <li>1½ tablespn. powdered sugar</li>
  <li>scant ¼ oz. vegetable gelatine</li>
  <li>scant cup of water</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil sugar and water and add to gelatine prepared with the scant
cup of water. When cool, add stirring, the lemon juice and fine
cut or chopped mint. Stir in freezer 15 m. Add whites of eggs
beaten with powdered sugar as in grape sherbet and finish freezing.
Ripen.</p>

</ul>

<p>Shred and grind nice, ripe pineapples. Prepare gelatine with
1 cup of water and add more to make 1½ cup. Cook sugar and
2½ cups of water together for 5 m. and add to gelatine. When
nearly cool, combine with pineapple and lemon juice; cool; stir
in freezer for 15 m. Add whites of eggs beaten with powdered
sugar and finish freezing. Ripen.</p>


<h3>Mina’s Lemon and Orange Sherbets</h3>

</ul>

<p>Rub measured peaches through colander; add cold syrup
made by boiling sugar and water together for 10 m. Freeze.
Stir in cream whipped and slightly sweetened, when dasher is
removed. Repack and ripen.</p>


<h3>Frappés</h3>

<p>Frappés are partly frozen mixtures of fruit juices, pulps or
fine grated fruits and when not too sweet are excellent in fevers
and are often served in place of a drink or a sherbet to well

<h2 id="CEREALS"><a id="Page_409" class="pagenum" title="409"> </a>
CEREALS</h2>


<p>“The grains, with fruits, nuts and vegetables contain all the
nutritive properties necessary to make good blood.”</p>

<p>“Those who eat flesh are eating grains and vegetables at second-hand;
for the animal receives from these things the nutrition
that produces growth.”</p>

<p>“The life that was in the grains and vegetables passes into the
eater. We receive it by eating the flesh of the animal. How
much better to get it direct, by eating the food that God provided
for our use.”</p>

<p>“Grains used for porridge or mush should have several hours’
cooking; but soft or liquid foods are less wholesome than dry
foods which require thorough mastication.”</p>

<p>When porridges are used, something dry like zwieback or crisp
crackers should be eaten with them to induce mastication.</p>

<p>Foods containing starch should be well insalivated by thorough
mastication before any tart foods are introduced into the stomach,
as acid hinders the digestion of starch.</p>

<p>The large proportion of starch contained in grains is changed
to sugar in the process of digestion, so the addition of more sugar
gives an excess of that element, overtaxing the liver and increasing
the tendency to fermentation, since both starch and sugar
are substances that ferment easily. Then if milk, another easily
fermented food, is added what can be said of the combination?
Besides: “the presence of a considerable amount of sugar actually
retards the digestion of starch.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">Dr. Kress.</i></p>

<p>For those who feel that they cannot at once forego the sweet,
stir in a few sliced dates to graham porridge or sprinkle them
over the top and serve with nut or dairy cream. Chopped figs
or stewed raisins may also be used the same with different cereals.
<a id="Page_410" class="pagenum" title="410"> </a>
A very harmonious combination is pearled barley cooked with
raisins. Nice ripe blueberries or black raspberries may be served
with cereals.</p>

<p>A complete meal may be made of graham or any preferred porridge,
blanched almonds, English walnuts or pecans, with dates,
figs or raisins. The combination will be satisfying without any
milk or cream.</p>

<p>My readers will many of them be surprised to find that oatmeal
and some other porridges are delightful served with cream
sauce, old-fashioned milk gravy, macaroni sauce and other gravies;
the cooked parched grains especially so. A poached egg
may be placed on each serving of porridge, with or without sauce.</p>

<p>Raw rice may be ground coarse or fine for different purposes.</p>

<p>The parched grains may be served with suitable, sub-acid fruits.</p>

<p>The toasted breakfast cereals on the market, prepared without
malt or any additional sweet are many of them excellent foods
because of the dextrinization of the starch, and we can easily
prepare dextrinized grains in our own homes.</p>


<h3>Parched Sweet Corn&mdash;the Ideal Cereal Preparation</h3>

<p>Put dried sweet corn into a corn popper, iron frying pan or
round bottomed iron kettle; cover, and shake over the fire until
the grains are browned and puffed up nearly round. Served
plain, this corn supplies a complete and satisfying food, as any
one will find who sits down with a nice fresh-parched porridge
dish of it and chews it until it is fine and creamy in the mouth.
It is much more delicious than the finest popcorn. It may be
ground and eaten in cold or hot milk, nut or dairy, and it may
have a little salt and sterilized butter mixed with it while it is
warm. A cup of cereal coffee or tea-hygiene with a dish of
parched corn makes a nice luncheon or supper.</p>

<p>The corn may be dried on the cob or shelled and dried. It
may often be bought from dealers in seeds, after the planting
season is over.</p>

<p><a id="Page_411" class="pagenum" title="411"> </a>
Parched field corn is a good nourishing food but not so sweet
and tender. It is usually better to be ground.</p>

<p>One doctor says, “I could travel the world around on parched
corn and never want grease of any kind.”</p>

<p>It is well understood that corn and oatmeal are the richest in
oil of any of the grains. In some countries the soldiers carry
parched corn in their pockets on long marches.</p>


<h3>Yolk&mdash;Egg</h3>

<p>Put yellow corn meal into an iron kettle or saucepan over a
moderate fire; stir until of an even rich brown color. Serve
warm or cold with hot or cold milk or cream. The donor of
this recipe says: “When I was a child this was considered a
great dainty, but I do not know how it obtained its name or
where we learned to make it.”</p>

<p>The different preparations of grains may all be parched the
same as sweet corn and corn meal in the preceding recipes. If
more convenient they may be done in the oven but the flavor
is not as good. Some of them are tender enough to be eaten
dry or in milk without any further preparation; others are better
to be ground before adding the milk or cream, and some need to
stand in the milk, hot or cold, for a time, before serving, while
others (rice especially) require cooking after parching. Some
are better cooked in milk.</p>


<h3>Pop-corn</h3>

<p>To pop: “Wet the corn slightly and let it dry on the stove;
put it in the popper while it is hot and in four minutes every
kernel should be turned inside out, crisp and tender.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">From
a clipping.</i></p>

<p>Serve the popped kernels plain with nuts, cereal coffee, tea-hygiene,
cream or milk, or sprinkle delicately with salt and turn
a little oil or melted butter over, mixing thoroughly.</p>

<p>Put together the poorly popped kernels of corn and all the
remains, cover with cold water and soak until soft, perhaps over
<a id="Page_412" class="pagenum" title="412"> </a>
night. Then add milk and cook in a double boiler ½ hour or so.
Serve with cream or more milk if necessary, or, cook in all water
and serve with cream. These left-overs may be ground and
soaked in milk until soft.</p>


<h3>Rusk</h3>

<p>Dry slices or pieces of bread in the oven and brown delicately,
grind through the food cutter and serve in milk or with cream.</p>


<h3>Porridges</h3>

<p>“Some people degrade these foods by calling them mushes,
a horrible name, by the way; the good English word porridge
is much better, and porridge is not gruel.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">An Editor.</i></p>

<p>Unless cereals are steamed, they should be cooked in a double
boiler or something that answers the same purpose.</p>

<p>A flat or round wire batter whip is the best for stirring the
grain into the water, as that keeps even the finest flour from
becoming lumpy.</p>

<p>The very most important thing in making porridges is to have
the liquid boiling when the cereal is put in. If it stops boiling
while the grain is being added there will be a raw taste to the
porridge, no matter how long it cooks.</p>

<p>Put the required amount of water, with the salt, 1 teaspn. to
a quart of water, into the inner cup of a double boiler. Heat the
water to bubbling boiling, sprinkle the measured grain in so slowly
as not to stop the boiling of the water, stirring continuously.
Let it boil up well, and if a coarse grain, cook over the fire until
it thickens, then set into the outer boiler containing perfectly
boiling water and keep it cooking rapidly the required length of
time.</p>

<p>Do not stir after the grain thickens. Watch that the
outer boiler does not become dry. Grains for breakfast may be
cooked while you have a fire the day before, then all that is
necessary in the morning is to set the inner boiler into the outer
one containing boiling water and heat it through. If there
<a id="Page_413" class="pagenum" title="413"> </a>
should be water standing on top of the porridge, pour it off before
heating, but under no circumstances stir the porridge, or add any
more water while heating, or a pasty, tasteless dish will be the
result.</p>

<p>When the porridge is to be re-heated, a slightly larger proportion
of water should be used, and for steaming, a smaller quantity.</p>

<p>One advantage in steaming is that the cereal (after being
started over the fire in some suitable utensil) can be turned into
an earthen dish and set into the steamer, warmed in the morning
and sent to the table in the same dish.</p>

<p>Farina, cream of wheat and similar cereals are more palatable
and nourishing if cooked in part milk. These finer preparations
may have milk or cream stirred into them just before serving.</p>

<p>Different lots of graham flour and rolled oats vary, so that it
is not possible to make an exact rule for them, but graham flour
should be stirred into water until the mixture is quite stiff because
it grows thinner by cooking.</p>

<p>Rye meal makes one of the most delightful porridges. Stir
the meal slowly into boiling salted water, the same as graham
flour, and cook for 1 hour at least.</p>

<p><a id="Page_414" class="pagenum" title="414"> </a>
Whole wheat is a very satisfying and inexpensive food.
Some families buy it by the bushel and use large quantities of it
in different ways. Some put the boiled wheat into bread sponge
before mixing it up.</p>

<p>Different kinds of corn meal vary, too. Only about ⅔ or ¾
as much granular meal is required for a given amount of liquid
as of other kinds.</p>

<p>Oatmeal is difficult of digestion, is apt to cause fermentation
and should be partaken of sparingly even when well cooked,
except by those of strong digestive powers. One young man
said in my presence, “I never know I have a stomach except
when I eat oatmeal.”</p>

<p>Cracked wheat is very nice cooked with an extra quantity of
water, molded and served cold.</p>

<p>With a Vegetarian Society mill delightful cracked wheat and
many other cereal foods can be made.</p>

<p>Cracked corn&mdash;samp grits&mdash;hominy, is a valuable food. Besides
the package preparations I have bought it at feed stores in the
East and obtained it from the mills in the West, and with a mill
it can be made at home. It should be thoroughly cooked. The
old-fashioned way is to put it into a round bottomed iron kettle
with salt and plenty of water (adding more water when necessary)
and cook it all day. It may be served with milk, butter
or gravy, or with any of the sauces used for macaroni, and may
be cooked with tomato and onion the same as pilau,<!--TN: changed period to comma--> <a href="#Page_131">p.&nbsp;131</a>.</p>


<h3>RICE</h3>

<p>“Rice is the most easily digested of all the cereals. The
Japanese, famous for their athletic superiority and wonderful endurance,
use rice unpolished. The rice of commerce is not only
stripped of much of its most desirable qualities, but in order to
make it attractive it is coated with glucose and talc to produce
the pearly appearance. Persons using such rice should be
careful to wash it thoroughly. After once eating unpolished
<a id="Page_415" class="pagenum" title="415"> </a>
rice, the rice of commerce will never again be accepted. To
eat polished rice is like eating shavings instead of real, satisfying
substance.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">Henry S. Clubb, President Vegetarian Society of
America, in “Life and Health,” and “The Vegetarian.”</i></p>

<p>Wash commercial rice in several waters, scrubbing it thoroughly
with the hands, in a colander set in a pan of water,
rinsing the colander up and down. Then put it over the fire in
cold water, boil for 5 m. and drain, before cooking after any of
the methods.</p>


<h4>To Boil Rice</h4>

<p>After washing and parboiling rice, throw it into 3 or 4 times its
bulk of boiling salted water, stir it over a hot fire until it rolls
up in the rapidly boiling water. Let it boil in this way until it
swells, then set into the outer boiler or on the back of the stove
on a pad until it is perfectly tender. If rice is cooked in a
double boiler, use the smaller quantity of water, and the larger
if cooked altogether over the fire. Do not stir after it begins to
swell. This is practically the Japanese method.</p>

<p>Another Japanese way is to soak the rice over night, drain and
put to cooking in an equal quantity of boiling water, keeping
closely covered all of the time.</p>


<h4>Chinese Way of Cooking Rice</h4>

<p>After washing, put rice over the fire in double its bulk of cold
water, let it boil up well, carefully lift cover to see if water is
all absorbed; if not, drain, sprinkle salt over if desired (the Chinaman
does not use it), return to fire closely covered and watch,
listening until a faint crackling of parching grains at the bottom
is heard; then remove to the back of the range where the rice
will just steam&mdash;“steam fragrant.” When ready to serve, carefully
stir the grain with a wooden skewer or some small round
stick, when the snowy mass should crumble apart into indistinct
kernels. “Try the Chinaman’s way and be convinced
that plain boiled rice is a palatable, substantial food.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">Adapted
from Mrs. J.&nbsp;N. Anderson, Canton, China, in “Life and Health.”</i></p>


<h4><a id="Page_416" class="pagenum" title="416"> </a>
The Indian Way</h4>

<p>Wash the rice, put little by little into 8 times its bulk (2 qts.
to a cup) of rapidly boiling salted water. Stir occasionally at
first with a fork until the rice is rolling up continuously from
the rapid boiling. Cook until tender, 15&ndash;25 m., according to
the age and quality of the rice. Be sure to cook it until it is
tender but not a moment longer. Drain in a fine colander,
pour cold water over to separate the kernels, put into the dish
in which it is to be served and set in a steamer or in the edge of
the oven for a half hour. The water drained from the rice may
be used for soup.</p>


<h4>To Steam Rice</h4>

<p>After washing, soak 1 cup of rice in 1¼ cup of warm water
for an hour or longer, in a dish suitable for serving it in. Add
1 level teaspn. of salt and 1 cup of milk and steam, without stirring,
for just 1 hour. Serve at once, or if it has to stand, cover
close so that the top kernels will not become hard.</p>

<p>All milk may be used by taking 2¾&ndash;3 cups. If the milk fills
the dish so that it is just ready to run over, the rice when steamed
will stand snowy white above the top of the dish.</p>


<h4>★ Baked Rice</h4>

<div class="subtitle">
A nice supper or luncheon dish or dessert.
</div>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½&ndash;¾ cup rice</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>2 qts. rich milk</li>
</ul>

<p>Parboil rice 5 m. and drain, add it to milk in pudding dish,
stir even in bottom of dish, set in slow oven, cover and bake
2&ndash;3 hrs. without stirring, or until milk is all thickened and
creamy with rice; if the milk boils over under the cover, the
oven is too hot. This is so delicious that it does not require
anything additional in eating but it may be served with sugar,
maple sugar or syrup.</p>


<h4>Parched Rice</h4>

<p>Wash if commercial rice, spread on tin and put in warm place
to dry. When thoroughly<!--TN: was 'throughly'--> dried, put in slow oven and color to
<a id="Page_417" class="pagenum" title="417"> </a>
an even light brown. Soak for 1 hour in an equal quantity of lukewarm
water, then add 3 times the quantity of rich milk, with or
without 1 level teaspn. salt to the cup of rice; steam, or cook in
double boiler for 1 hour. Serve plain. The rice may be ground.</p>


<h3>Granella&mdash;to Serve</h3>

<p>Pour just enough hot water over granella to moisten it a trifle.
Mix lightly and serve with cream. Granella is nice in hot milk.</p>


<h3>Baked Hominy</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup cold, fine hominy porridge</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. butter</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. sugar</li>
  <li>1 pt. milk</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>3 eggs</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix hominy and yolks of eggs thoroughly; add melted butter,
then sugar and salt and the milk gradually, mixing hominy to
smooth paste. Chop in stiffly-beaten whites and bake in buttered
dish in moderate oven. Serve as vegetable for dinner or as
principal dish for luncheon or supper.</p>


<h3>To Hull Corn</h3>

<p>2 gallons cold water, 1 tablespn. concentrated lye or potash,
4 qts. corn, white corn if possible. Dissolve lye in water, add
corn, and boil (adding water to keep covered) until the hulls will
rub off. Wash and rub in several clear waters until the hulls
are all off. Soak over night or for several hours in cold water;
drain and put to cooking in boiling water. Cook until tender,
all day if necessary. Add salt a little while before it is done,
then cook until as dry as possible without scorching. Serve
as a vegetable, plain, or with cream or cream sauce. Eat in
milk or with nut meats.</p>

<p>The hulled corn may be dried. Hard wood ashes may be
used to make the lye for cooking the corn, or a bag containing
2 cups of ashes may be boiled in the kettle with the corn.
By boiling for 4 hrs., the hulls may be removed by using 1
tablespn. of soda to each 4 qts. of corn. Some prefer strong
lime water for hulling.</p>

<p><a id="Page_418" class="pagenum" title="418"> </a>
Instead of soaking over night, the corn may be parboiled in 2
waters before cooking.</p>


<h3>★ Granella No.&nbsp;1&mdash;wheat, corn and oats</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½ lb. (2 cups) bread flour</li>
  <li>1 oz. (scant ½ cup) rolled oats</li>
  <li>½ oz. (1½ tablespn.) common yellow corn meal</li>
  <li>trifle salt</li>
  <li>about ⅝ cup cold water</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix dry ingredients and to ¾ of the quantity add water for a
stiff dough, then work in the remaining ¼ until almost too stiff
to knead; roll and pound out to ¼ or ⅓ inch thick, cut in round
or square biscuit and set in cold place for 2 hours or more.
Bake in a slow oven until a rich cream color or golden brown
all through. Then grind coarse or fine as desired.</p>

<p>When oat <i>flour</i> is used, ⅓ of a cup only will be required.</p>

<p>It will take 2 tablespns. of Rhode Island meal to make ½ oz.
and 1 only of yellow granular meal. The granular meal will
need to be scalded with a part of the water or it will feel sandy
in the granella.</p>

<p>The weights for a larger quantity are:</p>

<p>8½ lbs. bread flour, 1 lb. oats, ½ lb. corn meal, 1½ oz. salt.</p>


<h3>Granella No.&nbsp;2&mdash;rice, wheat and barley</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>¼ cup rice</li>
  <li>2¼ cups bread flour</li>
  <li>¾ cup barley grits</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>water</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook rice in one cup water, cool, add salt, flour and grits,
knead to very stiff dough, adding a trifle more water if necessary.
Finish as No.&nbsp;1.</p>

<p>½ cup rice <i>flour</i>, 1½ cup bread flour and ¾ cup barley grits
may be used instead of the above combination.</p>


<h3>Granella No.&nbsp;3&mdash;rye, wheat and barley</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½ cup rye meal</li>
  <li>2 cups bread flour</li>
  <li>1 cup barley grits</li>
  <li>salt</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="MACARONI_ITALIAN_PASTE"><a id="Page_419" class="pagenum" title="419"> </a>
MACARONI (ITALIAN PASTE)</h2>


<p>Macaroni is one of the most important of cereal foods. The
best&mdash;Italian&mdash;is made from a wheat rich in gluten, so to a great
extent it supplies the place of meat.</p>

<p>One of the first things we do when we go into a new place is
to hunt up an Italian macaroni store, as that is the only place
where the genuine article is to be found. That made in this
country, put up with a foreign label on the package, is inferior.</p>

<p>The Italian pastes come in a great variety of shapes and are
named according to the shape. Macaroni, spaghetti and vermicelli
are well known; then there are lasagne (broad and flat),
rigatoni (large corrugated), da natali, ditali rigati, cannaroni
rigati and reginnetti with mostacioli bianchi, soprafini (fine
vermicelli), ditalini and acini di pepe&mdash;a few of the many. There
are some small fine pastes put up in dainty boxes, especially for
invalids, that are very delicate and digestible.</p>

<p>Those who have visited macaroni factories in Italy where
macaroni is made for exportation, say that everything in connection
with the food is neat and clean and that the macaroni
is dried in closed rooms entirely removed from the dust of the
street. That which travellers see drying by the roadside, exposed
to the dust, is from small or private factories for home
consumption.</p>


<h3>To Cook Macaroni</h3>

<p>Do not wash or soak it. Break it when necessary and put
into perfectly boiling salted water, 8 parts water to 1 of macaroni.
Stir as soon as it is put into the water and often, until it
begins to roll up, from the rapid boiling. Keep over a hot fire
where it will continue to roll in boiling until well swollen and
nearly done, then set back to simmer slowly. When perfectly
<a id="Page_420" class="pagenum" title="420"> </a>
tender (which will be in from ½ to 1 hour according to the size,
age and quality, the better quality taking longer) turn into a colander
and when drained, turn cold water over it, or, let it stand
in cold water until ready to use.</p>

<p>Vermicelli and the other small varieties for soup require only
twice their bulk of water, and some of them require 10 m. only
for cooking. They will usually just absorb the water.</p>

<p>When preferred, macaroni may be cooked in just the amount
of liquid it will absorb, which will be about 4 times its bulk. It
may be cooked sometimes in a rich consommé, sometimes in
milk in a double boiler, or in milk and water. It is often partly
cooked in water, drained and finished in milk.</p>

<p>The “traditional” way of cooking spaghetti is to put the ends
into water and coil it around in the kettle as it softens, cooking
in full lengths and eating it the same, but the propriety of this
method is questionable. In the first place, its sauce is apt to spatter
in the effort to introduce the coil into the mouth, and mastication
is sure to be incomplete.</p>

<p>The measurements of macaroni vary according to the size.
For a large open variety, a cup and a half will be required where
it would take only a cup of a small kind, or of the ordinary pipe-stem
macaroni broken into inch lengths.</p>

<p>There is nothing that gives such character to macaroni as to
cook a little garlic with it, a very little for some tastes, not
more than ½ a clove to each cupful, less even, if the macaroni
is not to be drained and the cloves are large. We seldom cook
any preparation of macaroni without it, and people wonder why
our macaroni has such a good taste. Not enough should be used
to give a positive garlic flavor.</p>

<p>Pine nuts and sour cream give the cheese flavor. A good
quality of macaroni is good without any sauce, just cooked in
salted water and eaten slowly with nuts; but it may be served
with any desired, tasty sauce. The mushroom sauces, Italian
or Boundary Castle are especially delightful with it, but many
<a id="Page_421" class="pagenum" title="421"> </a>
others are excellent, olive and nut butter, old-fashioned milk
gravy, lentil gravy, a good cream sauce, cream of tomato sauce,
or any of the nice, meaty flavored sauces, or parsley butter.</p>

<p>Sometimes return macaroni to the fire after draining, and add
a little butter, with or without chopped parsley, for those who
use butter, or a little milk and butter or a few spoonfuls of cream.
Then another time, put this cream or butter macaroni into a
vegetable dish and pour a few hot stewed tomatoes over it.</p>


<h3>Baked Macaroni in Cream Sauce</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1&ndash;1½ cup macaroni, according to size</li>
  <li>2 small onions</li>
  <li>1&ndash;2 small cloves of garlic</li>
  <li>1 qt. water</li>
  <li>1½&ndash;2 teaspns. salt</li>
</ul>

<div class="title"><i>Sauce</i>:&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1½ tablespn. oil</li>
  <li>1½ tablespn. flour</li>
  <li>1 large pt. milk</li>
  <li>salt, crumbs</li>
  <li>chopped parsley</li>
</ul>

<p>Make cream sauce in the usual way with the oil, flour, salt
and milk and pour into baking dish, turn into it the macaroni
which has been cooked in the salted water with sliced onion
and garlic until tender and the water absorbed, and press down
into the sauce; sprinkle with crumbs and parsley and bake in
moderate oven until bubbling and delicately browned. If preferred,
¼ cup of flour may be used in the sauce.</p>

<p>Make enough of this dish for two days, and another day stir
salted tomato into what is left and bake as before for Macaroni
in Tomato Sauce.</p>


<h3>Macaroni&mdash;Pine Nuts</h3>

<p>Add ½ cup of pine nut butter or meal to the sauce in the
preceding recipe (by mixing a little of the sauce with it) and
sprinkle with chopped meats and crumbs.</p>


<h3>Macaroni&mdash;Corn</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>¾&ndash;1 cup macaroni</li>
  <li>3 cups boiling water</li>
  <li>1&ndash;1½ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>1 small onion</li>
  <li>½&ndash;1 small clove of garlic if wished</li>
  <li>1 cup canned, or stewed fresh corn</li>
</ul>

<div class="title"><i>Sauce</i>:&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup rich milk or thin cream</li>
  <li>½ tablespn. flour</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. salt</li>
</ul>

<p><a id="Page_422" class="pagenum" title="422"> </a>
Add corn and cooked macaroni to sauce, turn all into baking
dish, sprinkle with crumbs and pour a little melted butter over
if sauce is made with milk. Brown in oven.</p>


<h3>Browned Macaroni and Granella</h3>

<p>1 cup macaroni, ¾&ndash;1 cup granella, 3 cups rich milk (more if
necessary). Dry and delicately brown macaroni in oven and
cook the same as unbrowned. Put into baking dish in layers
with granella, turn milk, slightly salted, over and heat in moderate
oven. It should be quite moist when done. Unless the
milk is about one-fourth cream, there may be a little oil or butter
poured over the top.</p>


<h3>Macaroni&mdash;Tomato and Onion</h3>

<p>Simmer onion in oil or butter, add stewed tomatoes and salt;
simmer a few minutes and add cooked macaroni; set back
where it will heat slowly for a short time and serve.</p>

<p>Tomatoes, onions and macaroni may be put into baking dish
in layers, with a sprinkling of pine nut meal; with tomatoes,
crumbs and chopped nuts on top, and baked.</p>


<h3>Vermicelli&mdash;Asparagus</h3>

<p>Cook vermicelli in salted water, drain, spread on platter, lay
stalks of cooked asparagus on it and pour egg cream sauce over.
Cut asparagus into inch lengths if preferred.</p>


<h3>Macaroni in Milk</h3>

<p>Heat 1 qt. of milk in inner cup of double boiler, add 1 cup of
macaroni and cook until tender, perhaps for 2 hrs. Serve plain
as side dish or for luncheon or supper. It may also be served
with stewed raisins, with or without cream.</p>


<h3>★ Cream Mold of Macaroni</h3>

<p>Cook ½ cup of macaroni with or without a few slices of onion
and a suspicion of garlic, in 2 cups of water with ½ tablespn.
of butter until tender and well dried out; drain, add ⅔ cup milk,
1 large egg and salt. Turn into well buttered mold and bake covered
in pan of water in moderate oven until egg is set, ¾&ndash;1 hour.
Serve with Boundary Castle or any suitable sauce.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_423" class="pagenum" title="423"> </a>
★ Macaroni&mdash;Sour Cream</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2&ndash;3 cups macaroni</li>
  <li>1 pt. sour cream (or sour milk with butter or oil)</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
</ul>

<p>Add beaten egg and salt to cream and pour over cooked macaroni
in baking dish; sprinkle with crumbs and bake until egg is
set.</p>

<p>Rice may be used in place of macaroni, tomato also may be<!--TN: deleted double 'be'-->
added sometimes with chopped onion; a delicate flavoring of
sage gives another variety.</p>




<h2 id="BREADS_LEAVENED"><a id="Page_424" class="pagenum" title="424"> </a>
BREADS&mdash;LEAVENED</h2>


<h3>Yeast</h3>

<p>Yeast is a plant and success in bread-making depends upon its
growth.</p>

<p>Plants require warmth, food and moisture and thrive the best
when not too warm nor too cold.</p>

<p>A temperature of from 75 degrees to not over 90 degrees is
the most favorable for the growth of the yeast plant.</p>

<p>Compressed yeast is the most convenient to use when it can
be obtained fresh, but the bread made from it lacks the sweet
rich flavor of that made from a good soft yeast; so from the great
number of good recipes for liquid yeast I give two with which I
have had excellent success.</p>

<p>Use only mature, well ripened potatoes for yeast. Hops may
be omitted but the yeast keeps better and the bread is lighter
and sweeter when a few are used.</p>

<p>Keep yeast in several small jars rather than in one large one,
so as not to disturb the whole when using from it.</p>

<p>Bread rises slowly from yeast that is less than 48 hours old.
When liquid yeast is used, let it count as part of the wetting.
Compressed yeast is meant when dry is not specified in recipes
calling for cakes of yeast.</p>

<p>To use compressed yeast, slice it in rather thin slices, sprinkle
sugar between the layers and pour just enough lukewarm water
over it to moisten the sugar, not enough to cover the yeast.
Let stand until foamy and use at once.</p>

<p>One cake of compressed yeast equals 4 tablespns. of either
grated or mashed potato yeast.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_425" class="pagenum" title="425"> </a>
Grated Potato Yeast</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 qts. water</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. hops</li>
  <li>6 medium sized or 3 very large potatoes</li>
  <li>½ cup sugar</li>
  <li>¼ cup salt</li>
  <li>1 cup soft yeast, or 2 cakes of good dry yeast (yeast foam when obtainable)</li>
</ul>

<p>Dissolve yeast in warm water with part of the sugar. Simmer
the hops in water for half an hour, strain, add enough water to
make 2 qts. and keep at boiling point. Put sugar and salt into
a large granite or porcelain kettle, quickly grate the pared potatoes
over them, set the kettle over the fire and pour the boiling
hop water on to the mixture, stirring; let boil until thickened,
remove from fire, cool to lukewarm, add the yeast, beating
it in well and let stand on table or shelf in warm kitchen; as
it rises, stir it down once in a while; when well risen, set in a
cool place and stir down occasionally until it does not rise any
more. Fill clean cold jars about ⅔ full and when settled, fasten
covers on and put in ice box.</p>

<p>Use 1 tablespn. of yeast to each pint of water when setting
bread over night, and double the quantity for starting in the
morning.</p>


<h4>Mashed Potato Yeast</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1¼ cup smooth mashed potato</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. loose hops</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. salt</li>
</ul>

<p>¾ cup of water in which potatoes and hops were boiled, 1
cake of dry yeast dissolved in ¼ cup of water with a little of
the sugar, or, ½ cup of hop water and ½ cup of liquid yeast.</p>

<p>Tie the hops in a piece of cheese cloth and cook with the well
washed but not pared potatoes (the yeast is lighter if the skins
are left on); when done, drain and peel potatoes and rub through
colander on to the salt and sugar; beat well, pour water on gradually,
add yeast, beat, put into a clean glass jar, lay the cover
on without fastening down and let stand in a warm room until
full of bubbles, no longer; then set in a cold place. When
thoroughly cooled, fasten the cover tight and keep in refrigerator.</p>

<p><a id="Page_426" class="pagenum" title="426"> </a>
Use ¼&ndash;½ cup of yeast to a pint of liquid, according to the
time you wish to give the bread to rise.</p>


<h4>Dry Yeast</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup loose hops</li>
  <li>2 qts. water</li>
  <li>1 qt. pared potatoes in small pieces</li>
  <li>flour</li>
  <li>1 cup corn meal</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil potatoes with hops tied in cheese cloth until tender; remove
hops (squeezing bag when cool), put potatoes and water
through colander, and stir into the liquid while scalding hot,
enough flour to make a rather stiff batter. Beat well, add ½
cup of yeast or 2 dry yeast cakes dissolved in water. When
light, add the cup of corn meal or enough to make a dough stiff
enough to roll; roll ⅓&ndash;½ in. thick, cut into small square or
round cakes, dry in the sun or in a slightly warm oven (they are
sometimes dried between two boards covered with corn meal)
until so much of the moisture is expelled that they cannot
ferment.</p>

<p>If kept dry the cakes will retain their strength for a long time.
The small pieces of dough may be crumbled and dried.</p>


<h3>Flour</h3>

<p>White, graham and whole wheat are the flours most commonly
used in making bread. White <i>bread</i> flour is made from
spring wheat, which is richer in gluten than winter wheat and is
of a rich cream color.</p>

<p>Winter wheat flour is more suitable for cakes and pastry, and
for that reason is called <i>pastry</i> flour.</p>

<p>A blended flour, spring and winter wheat combined, is considered
by some the most nearly perfect bread flour.</p>

<p>Graham flour is composed of the whole kernel of the wheat,
its bran overcoat and all, ground up together. The bran contains
no nutriment and is irritating to some stomachs. Graham
flour is nearly always made from winter wheat.</p>

<p>In making whole wheat or entire wheat flour, the bran or fibrous
covering of the kernel is removed and the entire nourishing
<a id="Page_427" class="pagenum" title="427"> </a>
part of the grain is ground. Whole wheat flour is usually made
from spring wheat.</p>

<p>Some so-called “whole wheat” flours are simply very fine
graham; that is, the bran is all there, but ground very fine.</p>

<p>The best grades of flour are the cheapest as a smaller quantity
is required for the same amount of liquid. Good flour also requires
less kneading.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest deception has been practised in “gluten”
flours. Some which have been advertised as pure gluten have
been found to contain as high as 63 and 75 per cent. of
starch. A pure gluten flour for making yeast bread is out of
the question.</p>

<p>Flour made from new wheat will for a time improve with age,
but after a certain period it begins to deteriorate; so it is not
best to lay in a too large supply at once.</p>

<p>Keep flour in a warm, dry place, as all bread, cakes and pastry
are lighter made from dry flour.</p>

<p>“For use in bread-making the superfine white flour is not the
best. Its use is neither healthful nor economical. Fine flour
bread is lacking in nutritive elements to be found in bread made
from the whole wheat. It is a frequent cause of constipation
and other unhealthful conditions.”</p>


<h3>BREAD&mdash;YEAST</h3>

<h4>Suggestions</h4>

<p>Bread should not be set over night when there is the least
possibility of its becoming light enough to fall before it can be
attended to in the morning.</p>

<p>Dough mixed stiff at first requires double the quantity of
yeast of that started with a sponge, but as this method has
several advantages it is becoming the favorite. Beat the batter
very thoroughly for either method, as that has much to do with
the lightness of the bread.</p>

<p>Keep bread at all stages at as even a temperature as possible
<a id="Page_428" class="pagenum" title="428"> </a>
and away from draughts of air. A large pasteboard box is an
excellent thing to set it into.</p>

<p>A moist atmosphere is most favorable for raising bread.</p>

<p>Keep bread covered close to prevent a crust from forming
over the top. Paper is better than cloth to exclude the air.</p>

<p>To hasten the rising of bread, use a larger quantity of yeast
rather than a higher temperature. Above 90 degrees the bacteria
which were in the flour or yeast may begin to grow and
the bread will be sour. Given more time and raised at a lower
temperature, bread will be sweeter and of a finer texture.</p>

<p>Attend to bread at every stage as soon as light, before it begins
to fall; exercise especial care in this respect with compressed
yeast as it loses its life very quickly after becoming light.</p>

<p>Bread will rise better in a deep vessel, such as a pail or a
stone crock, than in a broad flat pan. Always oil the dishes
used for raising it in.</p>

<p>Each time that bread rises it loses some of its sweetness and
nutritive value, so the fewer times it is allowed to rise the better,
if light enough to be digestible.</p>

<p>Some cooks prefer flour that has been delicately browned for
setting the sponge for bread.</p>

<p>A good bread kneader is one of the best investments in cooking
utensils. It saves time and strength and makes better bread.</p>

<p>“In the making of raised or yeast bread, milk should not be
used in place of water. The use of milk is an additional expense
and it makes the bread much less wholesome. Milk bread does
not keep sweet so long after baking as does that made with water
and it ferments more readily in the stomach.”</p>

<p>In cakes and crusts where milk is used with yeast, sour milk
may be substituted for sweet with the same results.</p>

<p>To aid fermentation, a little sugar may be used in starting
bread, but not enough to cover the sweet taste of the flour.</p>

<p>At a great altitude, bread rises very quickly; and requires less
yeast.</p>

<p><a id="Page_429" class="pagenum" title="429"> </a>
Do not allow bread to get over light, even if it does not become
sour; for the sweet taste will be destroyed, and if in the
loaf, it will fall in the oven.</p>

<p>Whole wheat and graham bread will be lighter if ⅓ white flour
is used; and if white flour alone is used for the sponge the bread
will not be so apt to sour.</p>

<p>Whole wheat and graham bread need to be mixed stiffer than
white and must not be allowed to become very light or they
will fall in the oven and have a hollow place in the loaf.</p>

<p>Bread from whole wheat and graham flour requires slower and
longer baking.</p>

<p>Whole wheat, graham or rye bread may be steamed 3 hours
and baked slowly ½ hr., sometimes.</p>

<p>Salt delays fermentation, so when bread is started with a
sponge the salt should not be added until the sponge is light, and
it may be worked in at the end of the first rising of the mass of
dough.</p>

<p>When a large quantity of bread is made at a time, a smaller
proportion of yeast is required. Stir soft yeast well before using
from it. Do not let the jar of yeast stand in a warm kitchen
for a few minutes even.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give an exact rule for the proportion of
flour to liquid in bread as different brands of flour vary and the
same brand may be dryer or more moist at different times; but
usually not less than three times as much flour as of liquid is
required, and not much more.</p>

<p>Near the sea level bread dough may be mixed as soft as it can
be well handled; but as the altitude increases the stiffness of the
dough should increase.</p>

<p>Flour must be warm when added to bread at any stage.</p>

<p>Do not add any flour to bread after the last rising before putting
it into the tins, “as all the flour in it is, in a fermentative
sense, cooked and the addition of raw flour injures its quality.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">Charles
Cristodoro.</i> Oil the board and your hands instead.</p>

<p><a id="Page_430" class="pagenum" title="430"> </a>
“Bread should be light and sweet, not the least taint of sourness
should be tolerated. The loaves should be small and so
thoroughly baked that so far as possible, the yeast germs shall
be destroyed. When hot or new, raised bread of any kind is
difficult of digestion. <em>It should never appear on the table.</em>”</p>

<p>The loaves should be baked in separate tins, brick shaped
ones being best. If the loaf feels soft on the sides when removed
from the tin, return it to the oven for it is not done.
When done, leave loaves where the air can circulate around
them until cool.</p>

<p>Keep bread in tin or stone receptacles, never in wood; wash
them often in warm soapsuds and scald thoroughly.</p>

<p>Never cover bread in the box with a cloth, if anything is required,
use paper. Cloth causes a musty taste and smell.</p>

<p>Do not allow crumbs or bits of bread to collect in the box or
jar.</p>

<p>To freshen stale bread or buns, place them in a hot oven
above a pan of boiling water; or put into one tin and cover with
another and leave 10&ndash;30 m. according to size of loaf and heat
of oven.</p>

<p>Rolls are sometimes dipped in milk or water and heated in
the oven; or, put into a paper sack and left in the oven for 10 m.</p>


<h4>White Bread</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2&ndash;4 tablespns. liquid yeast, or 1 cake compressed yeast</li>
  <li>warm water to make 1 qt. of liquid</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. oil</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>3&ndash;3½ qts. flour</li>
</ul>

<p>Put yeast in a quart measure (compressed yeast will have been
dissolved according to directions) and fill the measure with warm
water. Turn into warm mixing bowl, add oil, sugar and salt
(sugar may be omitted), mingle, add flour until a drop batter is
formed; beat vigorously for 5 m., then continue to add flour.
When too stiff to stir, knead on molding board until dough is
<a id="Page_431" class="pagenum" title="431"> </a>
smooth and does not stick to the board by deft handling, place
in a well oiled deep dish, cover well and let stand in a moderately
warm place until light. It may now be folded down and
turned over and allowed to come up half way again, or be put
at once into the tins.</p>

<p>Allow bread to rise in tins to a little more than double its bulk
(experience will do more for one in determining the proper degree
of lightness than any recipe), and put into a moderate oven
with spaces between the pans; when well risen and moderately
browned, lower the temperature of the oven a little and finish
baking. Cover with asbestos sheets or paper if bread is in danger
of becoming too brown. ¾&ndash;1 hr. will be required for baking
a medium sized loaf.</p>


<h4>Fruit Bread</h4>

<p>Use double the quantity of oil and from ¼&ndash;½ cup of sugar in
the recipe for white bread, add 2 large cups of seedless raisins or
1 cup each of raisins and currants. Dates or figs may be used
when preferred.</p>


<h4>Nut Bread</h4>

<p>Use 2 cups coarse chopped nuts instead of fruit, in fruit bread
recipe. Brown sugar may be used instead of white, or sugar may<!--TN: deleted double 'may'-->
be omitted altogether.</p>


<h4>Irish Bread</h4>

<p>Brown sugar, raisins, currants and caraway seeds in fruit bread
recipe.</p>


<h4>Whole Wheat and Graham Bread</h4>

<p>Use ⅓ white flour and ⅔ whole wheat or graham instead of
all white flour in the recipe for white bread. These breads require
to be kneaded a little stiffer than white flour bread to prevent
their being coarse grained and falling in the oven; also,
care must be taken that they do not get too light before baking.
It is a mistake to put molasses or sugar into graham bread
as it conceals the sweet nutty flavor of the flour.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_432" class="pagenum" title="432"> </a>
Zwieback Bread</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. water</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>4 tablespns. yeast or</li>
  <li>1 cake compressed yeast</li>
  <li>⅓&ndash;½ cup corn meal</li>
  <li>white flour to knead</li>
</ul>

<p>It is better not to use oil in zwieback bread.</p>


<h4>New York “Home Made” Bread</h4>

<p>2&ndash;4 tablespns. liquid yeast or 1 cake compressed yeast, warm
water to make 1 qt., white flour for drop batter; beat well.
When light, add 1 cup corn meal gruel (to make, use 1 tablespn.
of granular meal to each cup of boiling water and cook 2 hrs.),
1¼ teaspn. salt, and flour for smooth dough. Let rise in bulk
once, then put into pans. A baker gave me this idea. He said
he had a great run on it once in New York City under the name
of “Home Made” bread. The bread is very moist and sweet.</p>


<h4>Oatmeal Bread. Mrs. Cobb, Bay City</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>¾ cup oatmeal or 1 cup (pressed down) of rolled oats</li>
  <li>1 qt. water</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. oil</li>
  <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
  <li>2&ndash;4 tablespns. yeast or 1 cake compressed yeast</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>white flour</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook oats in water as for porridge, 1½&ndash;3 hrs., cool to lukewarm,
add sugar, oil, yeast, and flour for sponge; beat, let rise,
add salt, and flour for soft dough; when risen form into loaves
and when moderately light bake from ¾&ndash;1 hr. Sugar need not
be used.</p>


<h4>★ Rye Bread</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. water</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. oil</li>
  <li>¾ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>3 tablespns. liquid yeast</li>
  <li>3 cups rye meal, not flour</li>
  <li>4½&ndash;5 cups white flour or enough to make a very stiff dough</li>
</ul>

<p>Let rise once in bulk and put into tins; when light, bake in
moderate oven. Add caraway seeds when liked.</p>


<h4>★ Rice Bread</h4>

<p>Cook 2 cups of rice in 2 qts. of water until tender; cool to
lukewarm; add 4&ndash;6 tablespns. yeast with water to make 1 pt.,
<a id="Page_433" class="pagenum" title="433"> </a>
1½ teaspn. salt and 4&ndash;5 cups white flour, or enough to make a
very stiff dough.</p>


<h4>★ Crisp Bread</h4>

<div class="title"><i>Sponge</i>:&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup water</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. oil</li>
  <li>⅓ cake yeast</li>
  <li>1½&ndash;1¾ cup bread flour</li>
</ul>

<p>When light, add 1 cup fine dry bread crumbs, knead well, use
crumbs to roll the dough, roll ¼ in. thick, cut into large rings,
let rise and bake in moderate oven until crisp.</p>

<p>Crumbs may be kneaded into bread dough and finished the
same.</p>


<h4>Potato Ball Bread</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 cups mashed potato</li>
  <li>1 cake dry yeast</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>2 teaspns. sugar</li>
</ul>

<p>Add yeast cake powdered fine, to the potato when lukewarm,
and the salt and sugar when cold; form into a ball, cover and
keep in cool place 2 or 3 days. When ready to bake, add 2 cups
mashed potato mixed with 1 teaspn. salt and 2 of sugar to the
ball. Make a ball of half the mixture and add enough warm
water to the remainder to make 2 qts. or more. Add warm flour
to knead, let rise in bulk once or twice before putting into pans.</p>

<p>Proceed in the same manner for each baking, keeping the ball
covered in a cool place between bakings. A new ball will not
need to be started oftener than once in three months if at all.</p>

<p>This yeast works very quickly and makes beautiful bread. Of
course for small bakings, half the quantity of yeast would be
sufficient.</p>


<h4>“Delicious” Bread</h4>

<p>I do not know the origin of this yeast but the bread is truly
named.</p>

<p>Put into a pitcher or some suitable deep vessel 2 cups of mashed
potato to which has been added 1 cup of sugar and 1 qt. of
warm water. Cover and let stand in a warm room for from 1
to 3 days or until covered with a foam almost like the meringue
on a pie. Mix some of this foam with 1 cup of warm mashed
potato, let stand in a warm place 1&ndash;2 hrs., add 1 tablespn. of
salt and set away in a cool place.</p>

<p><a id="Page_434" class="pagenum" title="434"> </a>
To the original yeast add 1&ndash;2 qts. water, 2&ndash;3 teaspns. salt and
warm flour to knead; when light, stir down, and put into pans
the second time it rises. Be careful not to let it get over light
in the pans before baking.</p>

<p>For the next baking, add 1 cup of sugar and the 1 cup of potato
reserved from the last baking, to 2 cups of fresh mashed
potato; take out 1 cupful as before, let stand in warm place 1 hr.,
add 1 tablespn. of salt and set in a cool place.</p>

<p>To the 2 cups of potato add a little water and set in a warm
place until light, when water to make 2 or 3 qts. may be added
and the bread kneaded up.</p>

<p>This bread needs to be eaten to be appreciated.</p>

<p>The yeast may be used in universal crust, raised cakes and
wherever other yeast is used, with delightful results.</p>


<h4>Boston Brown Bread. Corn and Rye</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. warm water</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. oil</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>¾ cup molasses</li>
  <li>⅔&ndash;1 cake of yeast</li>
  <li>1 pt. rye meal</li>
  <li>1 pt. granular corn meal</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix all ingredients, let rise; pour into tins, let rise, not too
light; steam 3 hrs. bake 20&ndash;30 m. in slow oven.</p>

<p>Raisins or nuts or both are good in brown bread.</p>


<h4>Boston Brown Bread, No.&nbsp;2.</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. water</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. oil</li>
  <li>¾ cup molasses</li>
  <li>⅔&ndash;1 cake yeast</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>1⅓ cup pastry flour</li>
  <li>1⅓ cup rye flour</li>
  <li>3&ndash;3⅓ cups granular corn meal</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix all ingredients except corn meal, let rise, add meal, turn
into tins and when risen not quite double, steam for 3 hrs. and
bake 20 m. to ½ hr. in slow oven.</p>


<h4>West Virginia Scalded Corn Meal Bread</h4>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup Rhode Island meal</li>
  <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
  <li>1½ cup warm water</li>
  <li>3&ndash;3½ cups dry meal</li>
  <li>¾ cake of compressed yeast</li>
  <li>1 small egg</li>
  <li>1&ndash;1¼ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. oil</li>
</ul>

<p>A little more meal may be used.</p>

<p><a id="Page_435" class="pagenum" title="435"> </a>
Scald 1 cup of meal with boiling water, add warm water, yeast,
oil and dry meal. When light, add salt and beaten egg, let rise
in the dish in which it is to be baked. The bread is best baked
in an iron skillet or frying pan with a cover.</p>


<h4>★ Corn Cake</h4>

<div class="title"><i>Sponge</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. skimmed milk</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. oil</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. sugar</li>
  <li>½ cake yeast</li>
  <li>4¼&ndash;4½ cups pastry flour</li>
</ul>

<p>When light; 1 teaspn. salt, 2 cups granular corn meal, 2 eggs
slightly beaten. Turn into well oiled pan to depth of 1&ndash;1½ in.,
let stand in warm place a few minutes, bake in moderate oven.</p>

<p>The quantity of flour will vary with the brand, 3¾&ndash;4 cups
only of bread flour will be required. The eggs make a finer
grained as well as lighter bread. One egg will do if eggs are
scarce.</p>


<h3>Salt Rising Bread&mdash;Suggestions</h3>

<p>Tastes and opinions differ concerning this bread but no other
takes its place to those who were accustomed to it in childhood.</p>

<p>With a little practice, salt rising bread becomes less work to
make than hop yeast bread. It is more wholesome and richer
flavored and keeps better than other yeast bread, and it has a fine
cake-like texture.</p>

<p>The experience of some persons is that salt rising bread is less
apt to cause acidity in the stomach than hop yeast bread.</p>

<p>The secrets of success with it are in keeping it evenly warm;
in not making it too stiff; and in not kneading it too much. Too
much flour renders salt rising bread dry and powdery.</p>

<p>The water surrounding the rising at different stages should be
at a temperature of 110 to 125 degrees, or so that it feels hot to
the hand, but not scalding.</p>

<p>In cold weather, an ideal way to keep the loaves warm while
rising is to put them on bricks in a pan or tub of warm water
and cover them with a blanket.</p>

<p>It is well to scald all utensils used for the bread with boiling
<a id="Page_436" class="pagenum" title="436"> </a>
sal-soda water and to use the same water to stand the yeast in
while rising.</p>

<p>While the flour added to salt rising bread should be warm, it
must never have been hot at any time before using as it is the
yeast germs which it and the other ingredients contain that
raise the bread.</p>

<p>The loaves should be wrapped in a thick cloth when taken
from the oven and left until cold. Salt rising bread makes sweet
and tender zwieback.</p>


<h3>Salt Rising Bread. No.&nbsp;1</h3>

<p>Mix 1 tablespn. each of salt, sugar and corn meal (white or
Rhode Island if obtainable) with 3 tablespns. of oil, pour over
all 1½ pt. of boiling water; stir until sugar and salt are dissolved,
then add 1½ pt. cold water that has never been heated. Add
warm flour for thick batter which will be rather thin after beating
(about 2 qts., perhaps). Beat thoroughly and set in pan of
water at 110 to 125 degrees or in some place that can be kept
at a uniform temperature much warmer than for common yeast
bread but not warm enough to scald the rising. When the first
bubbles appear, beat the batter thoroughly and repeat the beating
each hour until light, which will be in from 4&ndash;6 hours. The
rising should not be allowed to become too light at any time.
When the batter is light, close the doors so that there will be
no draughts. Have the pans oiled and warm, and the flour
warm. Add the flour rapidly with very little stirring, to the
batter; when stiff enough, turn all out on to a warmed, floured
board and work in quickly with as little kneading as possible
enough flour for a rather soft dough; form into loaves and place
in oiled pans, set in a warm place, covering well to keep a crust
from forming over the top as well as to keep the loaves warm.
As soon as light, place in a moderate oven and bake thoroughly.</p>


<h3>Salt Rising Bread. No.&nbsp;2</h3>

<p>To 1 cup very warm water add ½ teaspn. of salt and fine middlings
(shorts) to make a rather stiff batter; beat well, cover and
<a id="Page_437" class="pagenum" title="437"> </a>
set in a dish of very warm water, covered, beat 2 or 3 times
while rising. When light, turn into a warm mixing bowl, add
1 pt. or more of warm water, a little more salt and warm graham
flour (part white flour if preferred) for a soft dough, and finish
the same as No.&nbsp;1.</p>


<h3>★ Universal Crust</h3>

<p>For shortcakes, fruit tarts, meat and vegetable pies, pot pie
dumplings, crackers, buns, steamed puddings, loaf cake, doughnuts
and cookies, rusk and Sally Lunn.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup skimmed milk</li>
  <li>⅓ cup (large 4 tablespns.) oil</li>
  <li>¼ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. sugar</li>
  <li>1&ndash;2 tablespns. liquid yeast or ⅓ cake compressed yeast</li>
  <li>pastry flour</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix all ingredients except salt and add flour for sponge batter;
beat; when light, add salt and warm flour for moderately stiff
dough. Knead a little and cut into biscuit for the top of fruit
tarts or meat or vegetable pies, or place on tins for shortcake
crusts. For dumplings, use only ¼ cup of oil or 1½ tablespn.
of raw nut butter.</p>

<p>The crust may be kneaded stiff at first and allowed to rise twice.</p>

<p>If the crusts are not fine grained it is because you have not
used enough flour or have not kneaded them enough; but they
do not want to be quite as stiff as bread is usually mixed.</p>

<p>Shortcake crusts or tins of thin biscuit may be made and kept
on hand and just warmed up when needed, or laid over meat or
vegetable pie fillings or hot cooked fruit fillings and left in the
oven long enough to warm through.</p>

<p>We consider this one of the most valuable recipes in the book
since it can be used in so many ways in the place of baking powder
crusts.</p>


<h3>Sour Cream Crust&mdash;no soda</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup thick sour cream</li>
  <li>⅓&ndash;½ cake compressed yeast</li>
  <li>¼ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>white flour</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sponge or knead at once to soft dough, let rise, make
into any desired shape and when light, bake. This is very nice
<a id="Page_438" class="pagenum" title="438"> </a>
for shortcake crusts and can be used for nearly all purposes that
universal crust is. That the cream was sour would not be known
after the crust is baked.</p>


<h3>Sally Lunn. Breakfast or Supper Bread</h3>

<p>Use 1 egg, with or without 1 tablespn. of sugar to each cup
of milk in universal crust. Bake in shallow or thick loaf as preferred.</p>


<h3>★ ★ Soup Crackers</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup of skimmed milk or water</li>
  <li>⅓ cup (scant half cup with water) of oil or oil and melted butter</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. sugar</li>
  <li>1 or 2 tablespns. liquid yeast or ¼&ndash;½ cake compressed yeast</li>
  <li>pastry flour for stiff dough, 4½&ndash;5 cups</li>
</ul>

<p>Knead thoroughly (dough may be put through food cutter 5
or 6 times); when light, fold down and turn over and when risen
again, roll thin, prick all over quickly with fork or docker, cut
into any size or shape desired and bake at once before the crackers
have time to rise and acquire a bread like taste. Bake in a
moderate oven until well dried all through, but not too brown.
When properly baked these crackers are more suitable for soups
than unleavened crackers, as they are more porous and tender.
Tiny ones cut with a plain round pastry tube are attractive for
special occasions. They may be cut in larger sizes, sometimes
as large as a saucer, like the Swedish milk biscuit, for serving
salads or entrées upon. For salads, they may have a hole in
the center. I have an oblong cutter, made by bending a small
round tin tube into that shape, that makes pretty soup crackers.
Bake the dough in long slender rolls for Soup Sticks.</p>


<h3>★ Rolls</h3>

<div class="title"><i>Dough</i>&mdash;</div>
<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 pt. milk</li>
  <li>½&ndash;1 cake compressed yeast or 2&ndash;4 tablespns. liquid yeast</li>
  <li>½&ndash;¾ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. oil</li>
  <li>about 3 pts. flour</li>
</ul>

<p>Add yeast to warm milk with flour for batter; let rise, add salt,
oil, and flour to knead. Knead and pound dough until elastic.
Let rise in bulk or roll out at once. 1 tablespn. of sugar is sometimes
<a id="Page_439" class="pagenum" title="439"> </a>
added to light sponge; also 1 egg or 2 yolks or 2 beaten
whites.</p>

<p>An excellent way is to let the dough rise in bulk after kneading,
and when light, turn from the oiled bowl on to the board
and roll out without mixing.</p>

<p>For <i>Parker House</i> rolls, roll dough ½ in. thick, cut out with
large biscuit cutter, press across the center or a little one side of
the center with a small round stick (the bakers have a piece of
broom handle rubbed smooth with sandpaper) or knife handle,
brush one side with oil or butter and fold the other side over,
place on oiled and floured pan with spaces between so the shape
will not be spoiled in baking. Let rise until very light, when
nearly light, wring a cloth out of warm water, not too dry, and
lay it over the rolls for a short time. Bake in quick oven.</p>

<p>For <i>Crescents</i>, roll the dough as nearly square as possible, less
than ¼ in. thick, cut into strips 7 in. wide, cut the strips into
squares and the squares diagonally into halves; brush lightly
with water, then commence to roll firmly from the long side,
opposite the point of the triangle; leave the point underneath.
Lay on the pans in the shape of a horseshoe, when light, bake
in a quick oven. May brush with white of egg or thin cooked
starch paste when nearly done.</p>

<p>The <i>Vienna</i> roll is made by shaping the same as the Vienna
loaf (a little smaller at each end), about 6 in. in length. When
the rolls are light in the pan, gash the top of each diagonally
three times with a sharp knife. Bake in a moderate oven.</p>

<p>Roll dough into a long strip, cut into 3-in. lengths, lay close
together in pan, brush with syrup made by cooking together for
one minute equal quantities of milk and sugar; let rise, bake, for
<i>Finger</i> rolls.</p>

<p>Sometimes roll dough thick and cut with small round cutter.</p>

<p>For <i>Shamrock</i> rolls, put three small round balls of dough in
each gem or muffin cup.</p>

<p><i>Cleft</i> rolls. Make dough into balls; when light, cut each roll
<a id="Page_440" class="pagenum" title="440"> </a>
across the top with a sharp knife, about 1 in. deep, or, once
each side of the center, or, once each way, making a cross roll.</p>

BREADS&mdash;UNLEAVENED&mdash;WITHOUT CHEMICALS</h2>


<p>“The use of soda and baking powder in bread making is harmful
and unnecessary. Soda causes inflammation of the stomach
and often poisons the entire system.”</p>

<p>The chemical substances left in foods by the union of soda
and cream of tartar in baking powders cannot be used by the
system, so the excretory organs are overworked in their efforts
to throw them off.</p>

<p>Experiments have also proven that the chemicals of baking
powder retard digestion.</p>

<p>The use of yeast is preferable to baking powder or soda, but
breads made without baking powder, soda or yeast are best of all.</p>

<p>Unfermented breads are generally baked in small loaves, so
that they are dry and require thorough mastication.</p>

<p>Because of their dryness, dough breads are more desirable
than batter breads.</p>

<p>With the other advantages, unleavened breads have all the
sweet taste of the flour.</p>

<p>The substitute for carbonic acid gas is as pure and “as free as
the air we breathe,<!--TN: changed period to comma-->” for it is the air we breathe, the very same
thing; consequently it is inexpensive and the use of it requires
less time and labor than the making of fermented breads.</p>

<p>The <i>Essentials of Success</i> in making unleavened breads are,
after good materials (the flour must be of the best); (<i>a</i>) that
the ingredients be as nearly ice cold as possible; (<i>b</i>) that the
breads stand or rest before baking, in a cold place for from 20 m.
to 3 or 4 hrs., or over night; (<i>c</i>) that the oven is not too hot
when they are first put in&mdash;not that they must be beaten very
vigorously.</p>

<p><a id="Page_446" class="pagenum" title="446"> </a>
Iron is the best material for batter bread pans as it gives a
firm, steady heat. The irons with thin, flat, oval (not square
cornered) cups are best, but the small round cups are not objectionable
and the stick shaped pans are excellent. Next to irons
are earthen custard cups.</p>

<p>When meal is to be scalded, heat it in the oven before pouring
liquid over it.</p>


<h3>Gems</h3>

<div class="subtitle">
Batter breads baked in irons.
</div>

<p>Have materials and utensils cold, put liquid with salt, oil and
yolks of eggs when used, in stone milk crock or deep pan, agitate
for a moment by moving wire batter whip briskly back and forth,
when the liquid will be full of bubbles. Sprinkle flour in, not
too slowly, with the left hand, keeping up the agitating motion.
When the batter is quite stiff, beat it (never stir it as that drives
out the air) just enough to incorporate all the flour. Give a few
turns of the egg beater to the whites of eggs (which are in a bowl
with a little salt), so that they are full of large bubbles, rinse off
the beater with cold water, give it a shake and hang it in its
place. Turn the eggs on to the batter and mix them in lightly,
beating a little if necessary to mix well; cover the dish and set
it in the ice box (or in a pan of cold water with a wet cloth over
it) in summer, or in a cold room where it will not freeze in winter,
for not less than 20 m. and longer if possible. (I always
stir my gems up over night when making them for breakfast.)</p>

<p>Slightly warm the pans and oil them.</p>

<p>When ready to bake the gems, warm the irons a little and
without stirring the batter dip it into the cups, filling them to
the brim, set into a slow oven that bakes well from the bottom.</p>

<p>Bake until well risen, increase the heat sufficiently to brown
the gems nicely, then lower the temperature and finish baking.
Be sure that the gems are well baked to the center. Turn out
of pans at once and let stand for 10 or 15 m. before serving.
There is no objection to serving unleavened breads warm.</p>

<p><a id="Page_447" class="pagenum" title="447"> </a>
If the oven does not bake well at the bottom, leave the pans
on top of the stove where it is not too hot, for 10&ndash;15 m., then
place carefully in the oven.</p>

<p>When baking with gas, put the gems on the top grate of the
oven before it is lighted; use one burner only at first and have
that turned rather low.</p>


<h3>Whole Wheat and Graham Gems</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1⅓&ndash;1½ cup of milk,</li>
  <li>1 egg and flour for drop batter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Graham gems should not be quite as stiff as whole wheat.
Use the quantity of milk that will just fill the pan; skimmed
milk with 1½&ndash;2 tablespns. of oil to the quart equals whole milk.
Brazil or other nut butter or meal, with water, is sometimes used.</p>

<p>All whole wheat or graham flour may be used, but combining
either with ⅓&ndash;⅔ white flour makes gems more digestible.</p>

<p>The batter may be made thinner than a drop batter, but I have
better gems when it is quite stiff. I take only 3 eggs to a quart
of milk, but more may be used. When we are so happy as to
get a spring wheat graham flour, 2 eggs to the quart of liquid is
sufficient.</p>

<p>Gems may be made without eggs with all whole wheat, or
graham flour of spring wheat. They require a little more beating,
the longer rest is imperative, and the oven should be a little
warmer at first.</p>

<p>Cold boiled rice may be added to thin gem batter sometimes,
also grated cocoanut.</p>


<h3>White, and Sally Lunn Gems</h3>

<p>Make the same as whole wheat gems, using white bread flour,
and 1 egg to each cup of milk, add 2 tablespns. of sugar for
Sally Lunns.</p>


<h3>Fruit and Nut Gems</h3>

<p>Add a few English currants, seeded raisins in quarters, with
or without fine cut dates, or dried or fresh blueberries to any
gem batter. Use chopped nuts alone or with fruit. Ground
citron goes nicely with nuts.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_448" class="pagenum" title="448"> </a>

Beat egg with salt; add half the milk, beat in the flour and add
the remainder of the milk, and without beating strain into a
pitcher; rest. Pour into rather hot irons and bake in moderate
oven.</p>

<p>Sometimes the mixed egg and milk are poured gradually into

<h3><a id="Page_452" class="pagenum" title="452"> </a>
Oat Cake</h3>

<p>1 cup fine oatmeal, ½ teaspn. salt, boiling water, 1&ndash;1½ cup
perhaps. Grind rolled oats (not too fine) if very fine meal is not
obtainable. Pour over enough boiling water to moisten, spread
very thin on hot oiled frying pan or griddle (or spread spoonfuls
in cakes), bake on top of stove or in hot oven.</p>


<h3>Corn Meal Crusts</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup yellow meal</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>1½ tablespn. oil or melted butter</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. sugar</li>
  <li>1½ cup boiling water</li>
</ul>

smooth and pour ⅓&ndash;½ in. deep in oiled pan. Bake in moderate
oven. Split for eating.</p>


<h3>Rhode Island Johnny (Journey) Cakes</h3>

<p>Those who have not made the acquaintance of Rhode Island
Johnny cakes have missed much. To make them in their perfection
Rhode Island meal is required, though white meal will
do. Do not try them with yellow granular meal. Rhode Island
meal has a creamy tint and is lighter in texture than granular
meal.</p>

<p>Mix the meal with salt in a cake bowl and pour perfectly boiling
water over it to more than moisten. (A rule for the quantity
is out of the question). Stir, and if necessary add more
water. The batter should be soft, but the meal must be well
wet with the boiling water. Beat and drop in spoonfuls on to
a hot, well oiled griddle. Dip the hand in water and flatten the
cakes to about ¾ in. thick. Keep the griddle hot until cakes
are nicely browned on one side, turn, adding more oil if necessary
and brown on the other side; after which set back where
cakes will bake slowly for 20 m. to ½ hr. Serve with cream,
<a id="Page_453" class="pagenum" title="453"> </a>
nut cream or butter, or with some meaty flavored gravy; sometimes
honey or maple syrup.</p>

<p>In many families these cakes form the bread for three times
a day six days in the week, and one soon comes to feel lost
without them.</p>

<p><i>As Toast</i>&mdash;Split cold cakes, lay in deep dish with salt and
bits of butter and pour hot milk over.</p>


<h3>Pone, or Corn Bread “Straight”</h3>

<p>1 qt. white corn meal, 1 teaspn. salt, cold water for soft dough.
With hands moistened with cold water mold into oblong mounds,
a little thicker in the center than at the ends. Lay on hot
oiled or floured pan, press a little with the fingers and bake in
hot oven. Break (not cut). Eat hot.</p>

<p>A little oil may be added to the meal for pone, but then it
will not be “straight.”</p>


<h3>Ash Cake</h3>

<p>Brush a place clean before the fire and lay the pones upon it.
Let the tops dry a little and cover with hot ashes. Bake until
dry and firm, 15&ndash;30 m. Draw from the fire, brush off the ashes,
wash and wipe, serve. Buttermilk is the ideal accompaniment
to ash cake or pone.</p>

<p>A cabbage leaf may be laid above and below the cake in the
ashes; then it will not require washing, but will need to be baked
a little longer.</p>


<h3>Hoe Cake</h3>

<p>One hoe cake is the pone mixture baked on a hoe or griddle
in one large cake or in several small ones ¼&ndash;¾ in. thick.</p>

<p>Another&mdash;1 cup white Southern corn meal or Rhode Island
meal, mix with ½ teaspn. salt and pour boiling milk or water
over to make a batter thick enough not to spread. Drop by
spoonfuls on well oiled griddle and press ½ in. thick. When
nicely browned on one side, put a small piece of butter or a
little oil on top of each cake and turn. Bake thoroughly.
Serve hot. A teaspn. of sugar is sometimes added to the meal,
<a id="Page_454" class="pagenum" title="454"> </a>
but “no Southern cook would risk the spoiling of her corn breads
by sweetening them.”</p>

<p>For campers, the batter may be spread on a floured oak board,
the board slanted in front of the fire and the hoe cake baked “in
its original way and with its original flavor;” or it may be baked
on a smooth flat stone which has been heated and floured.
Sometimes the scalded meal is allowed to stand for an hour or
longer, then formed into cakes ½&ndash;¾ in. thick before baking.</p>

and turn. Serve with poached eggs if desired.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_455" class="pagenum" title="455"> </a>
Griddle Cakes</h3>

<p>Batter for griddle cakes should stand 2 hrs. or longer in the
ice box, or in winter in some cold place, to lighten it by allowing
the starch grains and glutenous portion of the flour to swell.</p>

<p>An iron or steel griddle is best for baking cakes. Soapstone,
so highly recommended, is objectionable because little particles
of the stone adhere to the cakes.</p>

<p>The griddle should stand on a not too hot part of the stove
and heat slowly for a long time before the cakes are to be baked.
Professional pancake bakers have their griddle over a slow fire
all night.</p>

<p>When oil is used in the batter, less or none is required on the
griddle.</p>

<p>Have the griddle hot before putting the cakes on, brown them
delicately, then turn once only. A second turning makes them
heavy. Cakes ought to be eaten as soon as baked, but should
not be covered when required to stand for a short time.</p>


<h3>Plain Griddle Cakes</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup milk</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. oil</li>

salt, 2 eggs, whites beaten separate, 1 cup bread flour.</p>


<h3>Nut and Egg Cakes</h3>

<div class="subtitle">
For those who cannot take starchy foods.
</div>

<p>Rub 2 tablespns. nut butter smooth with 2 full tablespns. of
water; add a beaten egg with salt. Bake on moderate griddle
to delicate brown.</p>


<h3>Dough Breads</h3>

<p>Grind dough breads 5&ndash;8 times through a food cutter with the
finest plate instead of kneading; it saves time and strength and
the breads are better.</p>

<p>A good spring wheat graham flour makes better rolls than
whole wheat flour, but poor graham flour does not make good
“anything.” The simplest rolls are made with flour and water,
<a id="Page_458" class="pagenum" title="458"> </a>
with or without salt, and require more thorough working than
those made with shortening. Rolls may be reheated whole, or
be split and toasted.</p>

<p>Sticks and rolls may be mixed with milk instead of water.</p>

<p>All crackers and wafers (except fruit) should be crisped thoroughly
in the oven before serving.</p>


<h3>Plain Graham Rolls</h3>

<p>Put a cupful of ice water into a cold bowl. Add ¼ teaspn.
of salt if desired, but the rolls will have more of the sweet,
nutty flavor of the flour without it. Agitate the water until full
of bubbles and sprinkle in the cold flour as for gems. When the
batter is too stiff to beat, take it out on to a cold floured board
and knead, using as little flour as possible, until smooth and
elastic. About 3 cupfuls of flour will be taken up. Divide the
dough, roll it quickly and evenly to about ¾ in. in diameter,
cut into 3 in. lengths and set in ice box to rest. Bake in a
moderate oven with steady heat until the rolls will not yield to
pressure between the thumb and finger and are of a delicate
brown.</p>

<p>If preferred, the water may be poured over the flour and the
dough kneaded the same. The dough may rest before being
rolled out.</p>

<p>The yolk of a hard boiled egg rubbed into each pint of flour
makes more tender rolls; or one beaten raw yolk may be added
to each ¾ cup of water.</p>


<h3>Nut Rolls</h3>

<p>Add ¾&ndash;1 cup of nut meal to water in plain rolls recipe.</p>


<h3>Cream Rolls</h3>

<p>Mix rich cold cream and graham flour together quickly. Press
together without kneading, rest for 2 hrs. or more, shape into
rolls and bake, or put on ice again until ready to bake.</p>

<p>Rolls may be kneaded, and if kneaded at all should be kneaded
thoroughly. Cocoanut cream may be substituted for dairy.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_459" class="pagenum" title="459"> </a>
★ Shortened Rolls</h3>

<p>The quantity of oil required will depend entirely upon the
quality of the flour, but for ordinary graham flour take ⅓ cup
of oil to each pint of flour; to a good spring wheat flour not
more than ¼ cup. Rub the oil into the salted flour, add ice
water for moderately stiff dough, press into a mass and set to
rest, unless preferring to knead. Finish the same as cream rolls.
⅓ white flour may be used with the graham.</p>


<h3>Fruit Rolls</h3>

<p>Roll shortened dough ¼ in. thick. Cut into strips 2½&ndash;3 in.
wide, put a strip of halves of stoned dates, pieces of nice fresh
figs or a roll of seeded and ground raisins along the length of the
dough a little one side of the center; slightly moisten the edge
of the dough farthest away from the fruit, lap the edge nearest,
over the fruit and roll it up in the dough, leaving a long roll
with the fruit in the center; roll over and over until the edge of
the dough is well fastened down; cut roll into 2 or 3 inch lengths
(1 inch for some occasions); bake.</p>

<p>This way of putting the fruit in the roll has the advantage of
leaving no pieces of fruit sticking through the dough to be burned
in baking, and also of not having any “sad” portion of dough in
the center of the roll.</p>

<p><b>Fruit and Nut Rolls</b>&mdash;may be made by adding pieces of nuts to
the fruit in the roll.</p>


<h3>Sticks</h3>

<p>Roll any of the roll doughs or the graham cracker dough to
about the size of a lead pencil or not over ⅓ of an inch in diameter;
cut in 5&ndash;7 in. lengths, rest and bake the same as rolls.
Sticks are more crisp and delightful than rolls. They should be
on the table for every meal.</p>


<h3>White Sticks</h3>

<p>Take 1&ndash;1½ tablespn. of oil to each cup of white bread flour,
with a trifle of salt, and water for stiff dough.</p>

<p><a id="Page_460" class="pagenum" title="460"> </a>
Dainty white sticks are nice to serve with soups, salads and
some desserts.</p>


<h3>Porridge Sticks.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 cup cold, thick oatmeal porridge</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. oil</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>½ cup graham flour</li>
  <li>1¼ cup white flour</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix and knead thoroughly. Dough must be very stiff.</p>


<h3>Beaten Biscuit&mdash;Whole Wheat</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. true whole wheat flour</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>⅓ cup oil</li>
  <li>1 scant cup ice water, about</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub salt and oil with flour, add water, knead until smooth
(the dough should be very stiff), then separate dough into several
pieces and put it through the food cutter 6 or 8 times.
This takes the place of the laborious beating. Shape into
small thick biscuit; make a hole through the center of each one
from the top with the thumb or finger, rest; bake thoroughly in
moderate oven.</p>

<p>If you have time to form the biscuit you will be well repaid
for your trouble as they are so beautiful; but if your time is limited,
roll the dough ½&ndash;1 in. thick, cut with small round cutter
and prick with fork. You may even cut the dough into small
squares. Rolled very thin, cut with a large cutter and pricked
well, the dough makes nice wafers. If a food cutter is not at
hand, beat with a mallet or the rolling pin, or pick apart with
the thumb and fingers, over and over again, until the dough
snaps when pulled apart.</p>

<p>A cup of medium thick cream may be used instead of oil and
water.</p>


<h3>Maryland Beaten Biscuit</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. white flour</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>2&ndash;4 tablespns. oil or 1&ndash;2 tablespns. butter,</li>
  <li>(use only ½ teaspn. salt with butter)</li>
  <li>¾&ndash;⅞ cup of ice cold milk or water, or half of each</li>
</ul>

<p>Proceed as with whole wheat biscuit.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_461" class="pagenum" title="461"> </a>

  <li>salt</li>
  <li>4 tablespns. oil or melted butter</li>
  <li>cold water or milk for stiffest possible dough</li>
</ul>

<p>Knead 20 m., or until dough blisters; set aside 1&ndash;2 hrs., or
over night; knead 5&ndash;10 m., roll and cut, or shape by hand. Bake.</p>



<h3>★ White Crackers</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. bread flour</li>
  <li>4 tablespns. oil, or 2 of oil and 1 of butter (2 of melted butter)</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>cold milk for very stiff dough</li>
</ul>

<p>Knead until smooth, run through food cutter 6&ndash;8 times, or
beat or pick as beaten biscuit; rest, roll thin, prick dough all
over, cut into any desired shape, bake in moderate oven. ¼ or
½ of pastry flour may be used; also water and a little more
shortening.</p>


<h3>Swedish Milk Biscuit</h3>

<p>Make white crackers of milk, roll as thin as paper, prick, cut
into biscuit the size of a saucer. Turn the wafers on the tins
often while baking. Serve with some desserts, fruit or other
salads, and with cottage cheese. Cut a hole in the center of
some of the biscuit before baking and serve salads or suitable
meat dishes on them in individual servings.</p>


<h3>Cocoanut Wafers</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2½ cups pastry flour</li>
  <li>1 cup dessicated cocoanut</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. butter or 3 of oil</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>water</li>
</ul>

<p>Rub butter into flour, add salt and mix with cocoanut which
has been ground through a food cutter. Add ice water for stiff
dough, roll out at once or rest before rolling as preferred. Bake
carefully so as not to scorch the cocoanut. Dried grated cocoanut
of your own preparing is preferable. 2 cups of cocoanut
may be used.</p>

<p>If a sweet wafer is desired, add sugar to the dough or sprinkle
with sugar before baking.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_462" class="pagenum" title="462"> </a>
Fruit Bars</h3>

<p>Roll any desired dough thin, cut into 3&ndash;3½ in. strips, spread
one half of the width with stoned dates, halved raisins,
steamed figs, sweet prunes or any suitable fruit, which has been
cut into strips with the shears; moisten the edge next to the
fruit, fold the other half of the dough over, pressing the edges
well together, and roll lightly to flatten the bar; cut with a sharp
knife into 2½&ndash;3 in. lengths.</p>

<p>Add nuts to make fruit and nut bars, or make nut bars sometimes.
The dough may be slightly sweetened.</p>


<h3>Crackers with Nuts</h3>

<p>Brush baked crackers with beaten white of egg and spread
thick with chopped or coarse ground nuts (English walnuts or
pecans or both). Put into warm oven to dry.</p>

<p>These crackers are nice to serve with fruit or vegetable salads,
or with cereal coffee or tea-hygiene.</p>


<h3>Graham Crackers&mdash;Sweet</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 cups each graham and white flour</li>
  <li>½ cup butter or oil</li>

5 or 6 times, roll about ⅛ in. thick, prick with fork, cut into
any desired shape, set in cold place for 2 hrs. or longer, bake in
moderate oven.</p>

<p>Omit sugar for unsweetened crackers. Dough may be kneaded,
picking it apart into small pieces, if food cutter is not at hand.
Or, crackers are very good made up without any kneading, when
rested in cold place.</p>


<h3>★ Sour Cream Crackers</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>⅔ cup thick sour cream</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. oil</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>pastry flour for rather stiff dough</li>
</ul>

<p>Rest and finish as other crackers. If the cream is not rich,
use more oil.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_463" class="pagenum" title="463"> </a>
Nut Wafers</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>½&ndash;1 cup fine chopped or ground nuts</li>
  <li>1 pt. flour, graham or white, or half of each</li>
  <li>¼ teaspn. salt</li>
  <li>water for stiff dough</li>
</ul>

<p>Finish the same as graham crackers. Nice with fruit soups.</p>


<h3>Fruit Wafers</h3>

<p>Roll any of the cracker doughs thin, place figs, dates, raisins
or prunes cut in thin pieces with the shears, on the dough, cover
with another thin layer of dough, roll with rolling pin to press
all together, prick with fork, cut in squares, rest, bake.</p>


<h3>★ Oat Cakes</h3>

<p>1 part oil, 2 parts water, salt, coarse oat flour to knead.
Roll ¼ in. thick of size to fit pie pan, crease in quarters, rest;
bake in moderate oven. The dough may be cut into crackers if
preferred. Grind rolled oats or oatmeal in food cutter, to make
the flour.</p>


<h3>★ Graham Crisps or Flakes</h3>

<p>Prepare dough as for plain graham rolls, kneading very stiff.
After resting, separate into small pieces and roll each piece as
thin as paper. When all are rolled, put as many as convenient
into a hot oven on perforated pans or on the grate of the oven.
Turn them over on the pans often while baking and bake to a
delicate brown. Serve whole or in broken pieces.</p>

<p>This is one of the most delicate and digestible of unleavened
breads and has a crispness and nutty flavor peculiarly its own.
It should be one of the staple articles of food in our homes and
is especially adapted to school, picnic and travelling lunches.</p>


<h3>Cream Crisps</h3>

<p>Mix with thin cream instead of water and bake in slower oven
than water crisps. With cream, whole wheat or white flour
may be used, as well as graham.</p>


<h3>Nut Crisps</h3>

<p>Use nut roll dough, kneading it very stiff.<!--TN: added period--> Beaten biscuit
dough may also be used for shortened crisps.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_464" class="pagenum" title="464"> </a>
Cocoanut Crisps</h3>

<p>Use equal quantities of desiccated cocoanut and pastry flour,
with water or milk for liquid.</p>


<h3>Nut Straws</h3>

<p>Take equal quantities of any nut meal and pastry flour, with
a little salt. Add just enough ice water to make the particles
hold together, roll out without kneading to ¼ in. thick, then
cut into strips ¼ in. wide and 5&ndash;8 in. long. Bake in quick oven
to delicate cream color. Serve tied with narrow ribbon in
bunches of 3&ndash;5 with individual plates of salad or on celery
dish. ⅔ nut meal and ⅓ flour may be used for richer straws.</p>


<h3>Unleavened Bread for Communion</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 cups pastry flour</li>
  <li>2½&ndash;3 tablespns. olive oil</li>
  <li>½ teaspn. salt</li>

</ul>

<p>Mix salt, flour, and oil together, add enough ice water for stiff
dough, press together as for pie crust and set in refrigerator an
hour or longer. Roll dough three-sixteenths of an inch thick,
prick all over with a fork, mark off in nine-sixteenth-inch squares
by a rule, cut into convenient sized pieces for baking. Lay on
a pan or perforated sheet, then crease marked squares half
through the dough with a spatula or the back of a knife. Bake
very carefully in a moderate oven.</p>

<p>1½&ndash;2 tablespns. of butter may be used instead of the oil, but
olive oil seems more suitable for the purpose.</p>

SANDWICHES</h2>


<p>Bread for sandwiches should be of fine even grain and twenty-four
hours old, except for rolled sandwiches, then it must be
moist enough to be pliable.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is well to wrap the loaves to be used for sandwiches
in damp cloths for three or four hours before preparing.</p>

<p>Dip the knife into hot water for slicing moist bread.</p>

<p>Thin, fresh crisped crackers or wafers are nice for sandwiches
when they are to be served right away, so they will not lose
their crispness. Wafers of pastry are suitable for some sandwiches.</p>

<p>Small round tins, like baking powder cans, are nice to bake
bread in for sandwiches. Be careful not to bake it too hard.</p>

<p>Do not cut the crust from the bread as a rule; it is the sweetest
and most wholesome part of the bread and the slices look
so “naked” without it.</p>

<p>Unless the loaf is of the regular sandwich style, cut it in two
in the middle, spread each cut surface, if butter is to be used,
and cut off a thin slice from each half loaf. Cover one slice
with the sandwich filling and lay the other on top of that, pressing
well together. Cut into triangles, squares or strips. Continue
cutting slices from each half loaf, then they will fit.</p>

<p>Cream (not melt) the butter before spreading; it may have
chopped parsley, onion or lemon juice or other flavorings worked
into it.</p>

<p>For rolled sandwiches, the crust will have to be cut off unless
it is very pliable. Cut slices thin, spread with the desired filling
and roll as close as possible. If they should not stay together
well, fasten with sharp pointed Japanese toothpicks.<!--TN: added period--> They may
be tied with baby ribbon.</p>

<p><a id="Page_466" class="pagenum" title="466"> </a>
Steam figs, seeded raisins and dates and grind in food cutter
for sweet sandwiches.</p>

<p>Scrambled eggs are better in sandwiches than hard boiled.
Hard boiled eggs may be rubbed to a paste in a mortar, with
butter and salt.</p>

<p>When mayonnaise dressing is used, put sandwiches together
just before serving.</p>

<p>Onion sandwiches, when carried, must be packed in a close
covered box by themselves.</p>

<p>To keep moist, cover plate with lettuce leaves, lay sandwiches
on and cover with dampened lettuce leaves. Or, cover plate of
sandwiches with a towel wrung out of cold water and set in cool
place. Or, wrap sandwiches in a damp napkin or waxed paper
and place in close covered tin box or stone jar and set in cool
place. It is better to have everything ready and put the sandwiches
together just before serving.</p>

<p><i>Garnishing</i>&mdash;Sandwiches are much more attractive if a few
sprays of parsley are placed around the edges before the second
slice of bread is laid on. Sprigs of celery or small spinach leaves
may be used, or a narrow strip of lettuce may be laid around
the edges, so that it will look like a dainty ruffle of green.</p>

<p>Sweet sandwiches may be served with cereal coffee, tea-hygiene,
egg drinks or egg creams.</p>

<p>Plates of sandwiches may be garnished with chervil, parsley,
lettuce, celery or carrot tops, ferns, leaves or flowers.</p>

      for the celery, and parsley used for garnish.</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>OPEN SANDWICHES&mdash;CANAPES</h3>

<p>These are daintily arranged bits of bread cut into rounds, ovals
or any fancy shape; sometimes toasted on one side; served
most suitably at a luncheon or supper and eaten with a fork.
Crackers are more suitable for some coverings. Much taste may
be displayed in the arrangement of canapes.</p>


<h4>Mushroom Canapes</h4>

<p>Toast rounds of bread on one side, lay toasted side down on
individual plates and cover the other side with chopped mushrooms
cooked in a small quantity of water with butter, and lay
one small broiled mushroom (or one that has been cooked the
same as the chopped), cup side up, in the center. Garnish with
lettuce, chervil, spinach or parsley.</p>


<h4>Trumese and Egg Canape</h4>

<p>Moisten hashed trumese with a little rich cream or brown
sauce. Toast diamonds of bread on one side and dip the other
side in melted butter. Scramble eggs soft and fine and place in
center of toast, diamond shape, then cover the remainder of the
toast with the trumese, making a diamond shaped border of it.
Lay a piece of green string bean cut in diamond shape in the
center; set in the oven a moment, serve on individual plates.</p>


<h4>Indian Canapes</h4>

<p>Mince trumese salad entrée fine and rub hard boiled yolks of
eggs with some of the dressing; spread on untoasted side of strips
of bread or thin wafers. Garnish plate with slices of lemon and
<a id="Page_471" class="pagenum" title="471"> </a>
tomato sprinkled with chopped parsley or with a leaf of parsley
or spinach on each.</p>


<h4>Russian Canapes</h4>

<p>Drain Chili sauce and rub through strainer, place pulp in center
of large wafer, surround with salted, riced yolk of hard boiled
egg, finishing with a wreath of the riced white of egg sprinkled
with chopped parsley. A leaf of green may be laid in the center
of the Chili sauce. Toasted bread may be used.</p>


<h4>Cottage Cheese Canapes</h4>

<p>Cover crackers or circles of toast with creamy cottage cheese.
Make a border on cheese of small leaves of parsley and place a
star or other shape of boiled red beet or carrot in the center.
Serve with lettuce salad.</p>

<p>Ripe olives may be combined with cheese for canapes. Pastry
wafers may be used.</p>

<p>An oxeye daisy, <a href="#Page_31">p.&nbsp;31</a>, may be placed in center of canape, in
the wreath of parsley.</p>

<p>Sweet canapes may be prepared in great variety. The sandwich
filling of cocoanut moistened with cream, with dates, figs
or raisins would be very pretty if wafer were spread with the
sweet pulp, then covered with cocoanut decorated with citron
or angelica and candied cherries in fancy shapes or chopped.
Pastry wafers would be especially suitable for some of the sweet
canapes.</p>


<h3>Sandwich à la Salade</h3>

<p>Roll strips of trumese salad entrée in crisp lettuce leaves,
fasten with Japanese toothpicks and serve on crackers or strips
of zwieback or with crescent sandwiches of bread and butter; or
the salad without the toothpick may be snugly rolled in a bread
and butter or bread and oil sandwich.</p>


<h3>Sister Starr’s Tomato Sandwich</h3>

<p>Chop together scrambled egg, oil and drained tomato (raw or
canned), not forgetting the salt, add cracker crumbs to make of
<a id="Page_472" class="pagenum" title="472"> </a>
the right consistency and serve between crackers or slices of
bread.</p>


<h3>Variegated Sandwiches</h3>

<p>Make three equal sized loaves of universal crust, one tinted a
delicate pink with fruit color, one left white, and the third made
of part graham flour with a little dark brown flour in the sponge.</p>

<p>When old enough, cut in slices, butter, pack together&mdash;brown,
pink and white&mdash;and set in refrigerator with weight on top.</p>

<p>To serve, cut in slices, then in any desired shape.</p>


<h3>English Bread and Butter Sandwiches</h3>

<p>Spread butter on loaf and cut in just as thin slices as possible
roll, fold, or place slices together.</p>


<h3>★ Trumese Sandwiches&mdash;non-starch</h3>

<p>Broil thin slices of trumese and place between them, scrambled
eggs, or fine sliced onions or celery; garnish.</p>




<h2 id="MILK_CREAM_BUTTER_AND_CHEESE"><a id="Page_473" class="pagenum" title="473"> </a>
MILK, CREAM, BUTTER AND CHEESE</h2>


<p>“The time has not come to say that the use of milk and eggs
should be wholly discarded.”</p>

<p>“But because disease in animals is increasing, the time will
soon come when there will be no safety in using eggs, milk,
cream or butter.”</p>

<p>“If milk is used, it should be thoroughly sterilized; with this
precaution there is less danger of contracting disease from its
use.”</p>

<p>State Boards of Health and Experiment Stations declare that
from fifteen to thirty per cent. of the cows from which our cities
draw their milk supply are affected with tuberculosis. In one
locality it was found that 65 per cent. of the best milk that was
presented was tubercular.</p>

<p>“Examination has determined that cream has from 10 to 500
times as many bacteria in a given quantity of milk as mixed
milk. The bacteria nearly all rise to the top with the cream.”&mdash;<cite>“Life
and Health,” April, 1909.</cite></p>

<p>In considering the question of appendicitis, a writer in the
<cite>American Medical Journal</cite> says: “The chief sources of tuberculosis
infection of the alimentary tract are the ingestion of milk,
butter and cheese from tuberculous cows....</p>

<p>“These authors (of the Experiment Station in Washington)
consider that a very large amount of butter infected with tubercle
bacilli is daily consumed by our people....</p>

<p>“Measure for measure, infected butter is a greater tubercular
danger than infected milk.... Tests show that in the ordinary
salted butter of commerce the Koch bacillus ‘may live and
retain virulence practically four and a half months or longer.’”</p>


<h3>To Pasteurize Milk</h3>

<p>Place a dairy thermometer, or one in an unpainted tin case,
<a id="Page_474" class="pagenum" title="474"> </a>
in the milk; heat, preferably in double boiler, as quickly as possible,
to a temperature of not less than 140 degrees F. and keep
it there for 40 m., or raise to 158 degrees F. for 10&ndash;20 m. Cool
rapidly. The rapid heating and cooling are necessary because
a warm temperature is most favorable for the development of
germs and the spores of germs which (spores) are not destroyed
by this treatment of milk.</p>

<p>When milk is to be kept for several hours it should be heated
in air-tight bottles or in bottles which have stoppers of sterilized
cotton, by starting them in cold water and keeping them at a
temperature of 149 degrees F. for a half hour after bringing the
water to that point.</p>

<p>Pasteurizing milk does not give it the cooked taste that a higher
temperature does.</p>

<p>When it is not possible to carry out these directions, just bring
milk to the boiling point, or set bottles of milk or cream in cold
water, bring the water to boiling and boil for 10&ndash;20 m. Of
course the bottles should have something underneath them, to
keep them from touching the bottom of the vessel in which they
are standing.</p>


<h3>To Sterilize Butter</h3>

<p>Boil butter in a generous amount of water thoroughly. Cool,
remove from the top of the water and drain.</p>


<h3>Sterilized Butter</h3>

<p>Pasteurize sweet cream the same as milk, cool quickly, let
stand covered in a cold place for at least 4 hrs; whip or beat in
a deep vessel, the inner cup of a double boiler or a pitcher,
(some think it easier to shake the cream in a tightly corked,
wide mouthed bottle or jar) until like whipped cream; then set
the dish in slightly warm water, to raise the temperature of the
cream enough to cause the butter to separate but not enough
to make it oily. Remove the dish from warm water just as soon
as butter begins to separate; pour off buttermilk and pour pure
cold water over the butter. Work a little and pour water off;
<a id="Page_475" class="pagenum" title="475"> </a>
next pour on water with a little salt (1 teaspn. to the quart) and
let it stand from 10 to 15 m. Remove butter to cold dish, add
salt, about ½ tablespn. to the pound, if unsalted butter is not preferred;
work a little, cover with a cloth wrung out of salt water,
and let stand a few hours in a clean airy place. Then work a
little and shape as desired. Do not work enough to spoil the
grain and make the butter oily.</p>

<p>This is the method with which I have had the best success.
The regular temperature for churning cream is from 58 to 60
degrees by the thermometer. Sterilized butter should be made
fresh every day.</p>

<p>“Protein is the most costly of the food ingredients and the
one most likely to be lacking in inexpensive meals, and is the
nutrient which skim milk supplies in a cheap and useful form.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">R.
D. Milner, Ph.&nbsp;B.<!--TN: as printed--> Farmers’ Bulletin, 363, U.&nbsp;S. Dept.
of Agriculture.</i></p>

<p>“Sour milk is the safest form to use if milk is not Pasteurized,
as the acid of the milk kills all the germs except the lactic acid
germ.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">Dr. Rand.</i></p>

<p>“People who cannot digest fresh milk or in whom it produces
a feeling of heaviness and discomfort, can eat large quantities
of curdled milk without inconvenience.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">W. Brown, M.&nbsp;B.,
Ch.&nbsp;B., in Edinburgh Medical Journal.</i></p>

<p>“Lactic acid precipitates the casein (clabbers the milk) but
does not affect the fats and salts. Its effect on the casein is to
improve the digestibility of this important compound, the meat
element, which is the most valuable constituent of milk....
As a matter of fact, sour milk is really a more healthful food
than sweet milk, digesting more rapidly and more completely.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">W.
M. Esten, in Storr’s Bulletin, No.&nbsp;59.</i></p>

<p>Directions for making artificial buttermilk come with the tablets
and preparations sold for that purpose.</p>

<p>As milk is a hearty food it should not be taken with other
<a id="Page_476" class="pagenum" title="476"> </a>
heavy foods such as nuts, legumes or eggs, but with bread, zwieback,
crackers or rolls, parched or popped corn and other cereals.</p>

<p>Clear milk is coagulated by the gastric juice and should be
taken slowly, in small amounts, so that the acid may have a
chance to mix with it and form the curd in small particles.
When drank rapidly, the curd will form in large pieces and be
difficult of digestion, often causing distress and disease.</p>

<p>Some can digest sweet milk better if an acid is taken with it,
but, as a rule, such individuals would better take nut milk and
cream, preferably nuts, and plenty of juicy fruits.</p>

<p>In fact, considering the increase of disease among animals,
it were better for us all to be learning more and more how to
prepare foods without milk and eggs, <em>educating</em> ourselves and
others <em>away</em> from them.</p>

<p>The next thing to copper or re-tinned vessels for heating milk
to the boiling point without scorching, is a nice clean iron frying
pan or round bottomed iron kettle. I have used a stone
milk crock.</p>

<p>Brush the inside of whatever dish milk is to be heated in with
oil or butter, as a still further precaution against scorching, for
scorched milk is unusable.</p>

<p>Wash all utensils used for milk first in cold water, then with
warm soapsuds, and then scald with perfectly boiling water.
Wipe with clean dry towels and if possible put them in the sun.</p>

<p>When hot water is poured into vessels before they are washed
clean, the casein is glued into the crevices, ready to make mischief
with the next lot of milk.</p>

<p>Condensed milk, containing cane sugar, is thought by many
physicians to be the cause of the great increase of diabetes,
especially among children.</p>

<p>A pinch of salt added to rather thin cream will cause it to
whip up light. Whip cream in a pitcher, the inner cup of a
double boiler or even in a tin can, something deep and small
around. Of course the cream and utensils should be very cold.
<a id="Page_477" class="pagenum" title="477"> </a>
Stop whipping while cream is smooth, before it begins to have
any rough appearance.</p>


<h3>Scalded, Devonshire or Clotted Cream</h3>

<p>Let milk stand undisturbed in a cool, well ventilated place
for 12 hours in summer, 24 in winter. Then set the pan carefully
in some place over the fire where it will heat very slowly
almost to the boiling point; it must not boil. (It is better to set
the pan in water which will come up on the sides as high as the
milk.) Let stand again in a cool place for 12 hours or until
thoroughly cooled. Divide with a knife into squares, and skim
by folding these squares over and over in rolls. Set in a cool
place. This is a most delightful substitute for butter on bread,
and it may also be used with cereals and fruits.</p>

<p>The cream may be placed by skimmerfuls in layers on a plate
instead of being rolled.</p>


<h3>USES OF SOUR CREAM WITHOUT SODA</h3>

<p>Sour cream may be used without soda in&mdash;Pie Crust; Shortcake
Crust; Dumplings for Pot Pies; Steamed Puddings, and all places
where universal crust is used; Salad Dressings in all places where
sweet cream is used; Soups, just before serving; Stewed Cabbage
and Stewed Tomatoes; Gravy; Macaroni; Cottage Cheese&mdash;much
better than sweet cream; Dominion Salad Dressing; Crackers;
Cream Lemon Sauce; Lemon Cream Sauce; Sauce Antique; Pie Filling
and Cake Fillings. With Green Peas, mixed with a little flour
before putting it in, it can not be distinguished from sweet cream; and
the same with all vegetables with which I have tried it excepting
string beans: in those it tastes a little tart. It may be poured over
Trumese in half-loaves or in slices to bake; and Whipped, when
the slight tartness is desirable.</p>


<h3>CHEESE</h3>

<p>The process of “ripening” in cheese is a process of decay,
and poisonous ptomaines are often developed. I have no doubt
but it would be better if cheese were never taken into the human
stomach. Our Father has given us such an abundance of
clean, wholesome foods to select from that we can well afford
to disregard the questionable ones.</p>


<h4><a id="Page_478" class="pagenum" title="478"> </a>
Cottage Cheese</h4>

<p>Skim a pan of well thickened sour milk, cut it carefully into
2-in. squares and set into a cool oven on an iron ring, or something
to keep it from the bottom of the oven, and leave the door
open. Turn the pan occasionally but do not stir the milk. Be
careful not to let it get too warm. It should never be hot, only
a little above blood heat. I have sometimes made it in the
summer by setting the pan in the sun. When the curd and
whey have separated, turn all into a bag and hang up to drain.
Do not drain the curd too dry. Season with sweet or sour
cream and a little salt; pile in a rocky mass in a glass dish and
set in a cool place.</p>

<p>Pass Chili sauce, Sauce Amèricaine or improved mayonnaise
dressing with it, in serving.</p>

<p>Thick strained stewed tomato may be used instead of or with
the cream.</p>

<p>If milk is stirred while thickening or while heating, it will
yield only about ⅓ as much cheese as it would otherwise.</p>

<p>If properly made the cheese will be soft and creamy, instead
of rough, dry and tasteless. It should never be used in anything
that is to be raised to a high temperature, as that would make it
hard and indigestible.</p>

<p>Cottage cheese is a strong meat food, being the casein of the
milk separated from the water.</p>


<h4>Zeiger Cäse</h4>

<p>1 gallon fresh milk, 1 pt. thick sour milk, 3 eggs. Beat eggs,
and sour milk together and stir slowly into sweet milk just as it
begins to boil. When curd rises to top, skim into colander and
drain.</p>




<h2 id="DRINKS"><a id="Page_479" class="pagenum" title="479"> </a>
DRINKS</h2>


<p>“Two-thirds of all the patients that come to my office come
because they drink tea and coffee. When I can get them to
give up tea and coffee, they can get well.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">Dr. Foote.<!--TN: as printed--> Omaha.</i></p>

<p>Tea and coffee hinder the digestion of all the food elements,
both nitrogenous and carbonaceous. They cause extreme nervousness
and irritability.</p>

<p>“To a certain extent, tea produces intoxication.”</p>

<p>“The second effect of tea drinking is headache, wakefulness,
palpitation of the heart, indigestion, trembling of the nerves and
many other evils.”</p>

<p>“The influence of coffee is in a degree the same as that of tea,
but the effect upon the system is still worse.”</p>

<p>Theobromine, the essential element of cocoa and chocolate,
is identical with the thein and caffeine of tea and coffee.</p>

<p>“Some of the best authorities claim that the quantity of theobromine
in chocolate is greater than that of theine or caffeine in
tea or coffee, and also that in equal quantities, theobromine is a
stronger drug than caffeine or theine.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">Dr. George.</i></p>

<p>A.&nbsp;B. Prescott, Ph.&nbsp;D., M.&nbsp;D., for many years Dean of the
chemical department of the University of Michigan, says in his
“Organic Analysis,” published by D. Van Nostrand Co., New
York City in 1892, <a href="#Page_77">pp.&nbsp;77</a> and <a href="#Page_513">513</a>: “Coffee contains 1 per cent.
of caffeine.” “Dry cacao seeds contain 1.5 per cent. of theobromine.”
“The physiological effects of theobromine are like
caffeine but are obtained by smaller doses.”</p>

<p>The increasing use of chocolate and cocoa in and with everything
is alarming, and we feel that we must raise our voices in
warning against this “habit,” since many are innocent in regard
to its nature.</p>

<p><a id="Page_480" class="pagenum" title="480"> </a>
“The use of unnatural stimulants is destructive to health and
has a benumbing influence upon the brain, <em>making it impossible
to appreciate eternal things</em>.”</p>

<p>As our bodies are made up so largely of water it is necessary
to take a sufficient amount to keep the tissues bathed and built
up, but it should not be taken with our meals, for solid foods
cannot be digested until the liquids have been absorbed, and
when retained in the stomach too long food <i>ferments</i>, making an
<i>inebriate</i> of the <i>water drinker</i>.</p>

<p>Fluids also dilute the digestive juices so that they lose their
power to act. Do not drink for a half hour or more before
meals, or within 1 to 3 hours after&mdash;persons with slow digestion
or subject to acidity, 3 hours.</p>

<p>If very cold or hot drinks are taken, the temperature at which
digestion is carried on is affected, causing another delay.</p>

<p>As a rule, the body gets the greatest benefit from water taken
early in the morning.</p>

<p>Pastor Kneipp recommended the use of small quantities of
water (1 teaspoonful), often. If one is situated so as to be able
to take a few swallows frequently, it is better than to deluge the
stomach three or four times a day; as a steady, gentle rain is
more beneficial than a torrent.</p>

<p>Hot water, at one time the great panacea, is responsible for
many cases of serious indigestion by causing the muscles of the
stomach to relax and become weak. A cup of hot water occasionally,
when one feels that he has taken a little cold, will help
to ward off the cold but it should not be often repeated.</p>

<p>The advice of one doctor of great sense and considerable reputation
was “Drink cold water <em>when thirsty</em>.”</p>

<p>Pure <i>Distilled Water</i> is unquestionably the best drink.
<i>Mineral Waters</i> sometimes have a beneficial effect when used
for a short time, but that is lost by their continued use and after
a few weeks the individual begins to suffer with serious stomach
and kidney difficulties.</p>

<p><a id="Page_481" class="pagenum" title="481"> </a>
“<i>Very Hard Water</i> is not only unpleasant to the skin and difficult
to make into a lather, but, what is more important still, it
exerts a more or less harmful influence upon the digestive system.
Constipation is not infrequently the direct result of the constant
use of hard water. Wherever possible apparatus should be used
for the purpose of distilling hard water. If this is impracticable,
boiling the water will materially reduce the hardness. The flatness
of boiled water is easily and quickly remedied by aerating it.
Pouring water back and forth from one glass to another will
speedily restore its oxygen.”&mdash;<cite>English Good Health.</cite></p>

<p>The liberal use of <i>Fresh Juicy Fruits</i> helps out in the amount
of fluids. I have known a few people who ate no meat and
almost no vegetables, but did use juicy acid fruits in abundance,
who never felt the pangs of thirst, and they were in exceptionally
good health, with great powers of endurance.</p>

<p>The change of water in travelling affects many people unfavorably
and often it is difficult to obtain pure water. The substitution
of juicy fruits at such times banishes the difficulties.</p>


<h3>Fruit Nectars</h3>

<p>We make “fruit nectars” by adding lemon juice, sugar and
water (the less sugar the better, a sugar syrup is preferable) to
pure fruit juices and to combinations of fruit juices. Some, such
as grape and black raspberry, will bear a good deal of water, but
pineapple and other delicate flavored juices very little.</p>

<p>If pineapple is combined with another juice, let it be something
without a strong, positive flavor (as orange or strawberry),
or the pineapple juice will be wasted. A strong and a neutral
flavored juice, red raspberry and currant for instance, go well
together. Lemon juice gives character to all. Peach and grape
juice, or apple and grape juice are good combinations.</p>

<p>To fully enjoy the flavors, do not serve drinks ice cold.</p>


<h4>Banana Lemon Nectar</h4>

<p><i>Syrup</i>&mdash;3&ndash;4 cups water, ½ cup sugar, boil; add ½ cup lemon
<a id="Page_482" class="pagenum" title="482"> </a>
juice, cool. Cut 1 large banana in small pieces; pour syrup over,
let stand in refrigerator 2 hours or longer; strain or not; serve
with thin slices of lemon.</p>


<h4>Orange Banana Nectar</h4>

<p>Cut half a small orange into sections, rind and all and add to
banana syrup about 20 m. before serving. Before straining, put
sections into glasses, pour the strained syrup over them and serve.</p>


<h4>Orange Nectar</h4>

<p>Add sections of orange to lemon syrup without the banana.</p>


<h4>Mint Orange Nectar</h4>

<p>Add shredded mint to orange nectar.</p>


<h3>Lemonades</h3>

<p>Lemonade, with but little sugar, has no equal as a drink because
of the purifying effect of the lemon juice upon both the
water and the individual.</p>

<p>A strong lemonade requires less sugar in proportion than one
having a large quantity of water. A sugar syrup is best for
sweetening, and the less used the better.</p>

<p><i>Mint</i>&mdash;Sprinkle fine cut spearmint into lemonade 10 to 15 m.
before serving. Very cooling and refreshing.</p>

<p><i>Egg</i>&mdash;1 egg, 2 tablespns. sugar, 2½ tablespns. lemon juice,
water to make 2 glasses. Beat egg and sugar, add lemon juice
and beat, then add water.</p>

<p><i>White of Egg</i>&mdash;2&ndash;2½ tablespns. lemon juice, white of 1 egg,
1 tablespn. sugar. Beat white of egg and sugar, add lemon juice,
then water.</p>

<p><i>Milk and Egg</i>&mdash;1 egg, ¼&ndash;½ cup milk, 1 teaspn. or more lemon
juice, a little grated rind of lemon. Beat yolk of egg and add
cold milk, turn into glass; beat white of egg with a trifle of salt
and add half the lemon juice; add remainder of lemon juice to
the yolk and milk, lay white on top and serve at once.</p>


<h3>Egg Orangeade</h3>

<p>Beat the white of 1 egg with the juice of 1 large sweet orange,
strain.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_483" class="pagenum" title="483"> </a>
To Prepare Fruit Juices</h3>

<p>The most desirable juices for drinks are made from fresh, ripe,
uncooked fruits by crushing, and straining through a cloth. It
is better to pour cold water over some fruits and let them stand
for a while before straining. Apples may be sliced or chopped
and water added.</p>

<p>For canning fruit juices, see <a href="#Page_60">pp.&nbsp;60</a>, <a href="#Page_61">61</a>. The liquid from soaking
acid dried fruits in water for several hours (without cooking)
is refreshing; also the juice in which chopped raisins have been
steeped.</p>


<h3>Cranberry Juice</h3>

<p>Crush or grind 1 qt. of cranberries, pour 1 qt. of boiling
water over, cool; add sugar after straining and stir until it is dissolved.</p>


<h3>Cereal Coffees or Drinks</h3>

<p>The bulk of the so-called “cereal” drinks on the market
have some commercial coffee in them, as well as chicory. There
are a few, however, made of combinations of grains, or of fruits,
nuts and grains, only. Those containing chicory require a long
boiling, according to the directions on the packages, to destroy
the rank, harsh flavor of the chicory; and the ones made of
parched grains without caramel in any form are improved by
long steeping to develop the mild flavor. But it is a great mistake
to boil those having a characteristic, agreeable flavor any more
than we used to boil Java or Mocha. To make these, put the
cereal (from 1 teaspn. to 1½ tablespn. to each cup of water according
to taste) into perfectly boiling water, allow it to just
boil up, then stand on the back of the range where it cannot
boil, for from 5&ndash;10 m. Serve with nice rich sterilized cream
(hot better). When cream is not obtainable and the drink must
be served, hot scalded milk gives a better flavor than unscalded
milk, but as a rule, it is better to omit the coffee when you have
no cream.</p>

<p>Never make cereal coffee in a tin coffee pot that commercial
coffee has been made in. It would ruin the flavor.</p>

<p><a id="Page_484" class="pagenum" title="484"> </a>
We do not advise the drinking of even cereal coffee, but use
it to win people from injurious beverages.</p>


<h3>To Make a Cereal<!--TN: was 'Cerial'--> Drink</h3>

<p>It is very convenient to know how to make a cereal coffee,
though if one’s time is worth much and a good coffee is to be
obtained, it is cheaper to buy it. The following recipe is one
that I have used for years and it is excellent. None of the
whole grains equal bran for the drink.</p>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 qt. wheat bran pressed down lightly</li>
  <li>1 pt. corn meal</li>
  <li>½ cup hot water</li>
  <li>⅔ cup nice-flavored dark molasses</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix bran and corn meal and pour over them the molasses and
hot water which have been combined. Rub all together with
the hands until smooth; set in a warm oven and stir occasionally
until well dried out, then increase the heat of the oven,
stirring the mixture often; at the last have the oven very hot
and stir almost constantly until cereal is a dark chestnut brown,
which will take but a short time at the last. Remove from the
oven and stir until cooled a little so that it will not brown more
by its own heat, and put into a close covered can.</p>

<p>When preparing to serve, use ½&ndash;1 cup of the coffee to each
quart of boiling water, let it just boil up and stand for 5 m.
Different combinations of grains are browned and ground for
drinks. Barley is much liked by some, rye by others. Carrot
and celery roots dried and browned are good, and browned peas
are excellent.</p>


<h3>Tea-Hygiene</h3>

<p>Celery and raspberry leaf tea have been served in some of the
restaurants in New York City for several years and are both
good. Either the tops (fresh or dry) or seeds of celery may be
used. Crush the seeds before steeping. I have also used mint,
anise, tarragon, catnip and thyme for tea and found them all
pleasant drinks. Steep them for 15&ndash;20 m., strain and serve
with cream only. You will be surprised I am sure when you
<a id="Page_485" class="pagenum" title="485"> </a>
try them. Do not allow catnip tea to stand with the leaves if
to be re-heated.</p>


<h3>Bran Tea</h3>

<p>Brown bran delicately. Take 2 tablespns. for each cup of
water, boil up well or steep for 20 m. Dried unbrowned bran
may be used with longer cooking.</p>


<h3>Cold Cereal Coffee</h3>

<p>Pour hot coffee over cream or cream and sugar. Cool. For
luncheon or supper.</p>


<h3>Eggnog</h3>

<p>1 egg, ½&ndash;¾ cup of milk, 1 teaspn. or no sugar, flavoring or
not. Beat or shake until foamy, pour into glass and serve with
or without whipped cream on top. Eggnog does not necessarily
contain liquor.</p>


<h3>Hot Eggnog</h3>

<p>Beat 1 egg with or without a teaspn. of sugar and a few drops
of vanilla. Pour ½&ndash;¾ cup of hot milk over, stirring. Turn
into warm glass and serve at once.</p>


<h3>Cream for Coffee</h3>

<p>Beat 1 egg to a foam, add 1 tablespn. white sugar and pour a
pint of boiling hot milk over, stirring briskly. Prepare at night
for morning.</p>


<h3>Cream for Coffee No.&nbsp;2</h3>

<p>Pour 1 pt. boiling milk on beaten yolk of 1 egg mixed with 2
tablespns. cold milk. Set back on the stove to scald but not boil.</p>

<p>“Food should not be washed down. No drink is needed with
the meals. Eat slowly and allow the saliva to mingle with the
food. Hot drinks are debilitating. Do not eat largely of salt;
give up bottled pickles; keep fiery spiced food out of your stomach;
eat fruit with your meals, and the irritation which calls for so
much drink will cease to exist. But if anything is needed to
quench thirst, pure water drunk some little time before or after
a meal is all that nature requires.”</p>




<h2 id="INVALID_FOODS"><a id="Page_486" class="pagenum" title="486"> </a>
INVALID FOODS</h2>


<p>“Diet in the hands of an expert is far more effective than
drugs. I speak from a large experience in both systems.”&mdash;<cite>“Food
and Condition.” Dr. Yorke Davis, London.</cite></p>

<p>“In many cases of sickness the very best remedy is for the
patient to fast for a meal or two, that the overworked organs
of digestion may have an opportunity to rest.”</p>

<p>“A fruit diet for a few days has often brought great relief to
brain workers.”</p>

<p>“Many times a short period of entire abstinence from food,
followed by simple, moderate eating, has led to recovery through
nature’s own recuperative effort. An abstemious diet for a
month or two would convince many sufferers that the path of
self-denial is the path to health.”</p>

<p>“There are some who would be benefited more by abstinence
from food for a day or two every week than by any amount of
treatment or medical advice. To fast one day a week would be
of incalculable benefit to them.”</p>


<h3>Suggestions</h3>

<p>Whatever food is taken to the sick should be prepared and
served daintily and neatly. If the tray cloth is ever so coarse
or only a paper napkin, have it clean; use the daintiest and prettiest
china to be found and serve the food in small quantities,
without any drops or streaks on the edge of the dishes. A flower
or leaf by the side of the plate, will give zest to the food.</p>

<p>Food should be simple, nutritious and easily digested. Suitable
dishes are scattered all through the book. Among the
soups are the broths and others, supplying the needs of different
cases. There are toasts in variety; they may be served in delicate
squares, triangles and crescents.</p>

<p>Rice flour blanc mange, sea moss blanc mange, buttermilk,
<a id="Page_487" class="pagenum" title="487"> </a>
parched grains, egg creams, fruit whips and ices are suggestive
of some of the especially suitable dishes. Fruits and fruit juices
are nearly always indicated. Baked apples, sweet and sour,
without sugar, are staple invalid dishes. Before serving grapes,
remove the seeds with two silver forks on a plate, then put the
pulp and juice into a sauce dish or glass. Serve the pulp only,
of oranges. (<a href="#Page_42">p.&nbsp;42</a>.)</p>

<p>The most desirable gruels are those made of the dextrinized
or parched cereals, but when the undextrinized grains are used
they should be cooked as long as for porridges, in a somewhat
larger quantity of water, strained, and thinned with milk, or
cream and water. They may sometimes be cooked in milk.
Cold porridges may be used.</p>


<h3>Granella Malted Milk Gruel</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1&ndash;1½ tablespn. granella</li>
  <li>2&ndash;3 teaspns. malted milk</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. thin cream</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>water</li>
</ul>

<p>Cook granella in water to soften, strain, add malted milk,
cream and salt which have been blended; heat, serve.</p>


<h3>Egg Gruel</h3>

<p>Poached yolks of 3 eggs, 1&ndash;2 cups milk. Rub yolks of eggs
smooth, add hot milk, gradually, strain, reheat, salt, serve.</p>


<h3>Parched Corn Broth</h3>

<p>Pour hot milk over parched corn meal or cracked parched
corn; let stand 5&ndash;10 m., strain. May use water and cream.</p>


<h3>Almond Gruel</h3>

<p>1 tablespn. almond butter, 1 cup water, salt. Mix butter
with water, add salt, boil, serve.</p>


<h3>Raisin Gruel</h3>

<p>Boil 1½ cup raisins in 1 qt. milk and water, equal parts, for
½ hour; strain, squeezing well, thicken with 1&ndash;2 teaspns. flour
blended with water, add salt.</p>


<h3>White of Egg</h3>

<p>Dissolve the whites of 2 or 3 eggs in a glass of water and give
a few teaspoonfuls every 2 or 3 hours.</p>




<h2 id="CONFECTIONS"><a id="Page_488" class="pagenum" title="488"> </a>
CONFECTIONS</h2>


<p>“Sugar clogs the system. It hinders the working of the living
machine.”</p>

<p>Children are not naturally fond of sweets, but with few exceptions
their taste has been educated to them from the cradle.
I have known children who were so unaccustomed to candies
that if they were given them they would merely play with them,
never thinking of putting them into their mouths, and others
who would say when a sweet dessert was given them, “I don’t
like that, it is too sweet.”</p>

<p>Much life-long suffering would be avoided if children were
given plenty of good ripe fruit, sweet and sour, instead of confections.
If, however, it seems best sometimes to make something
in this line, select the simplest and least harmful.</p>


<h3>Stuffed Dates</h3>

<p>Mix unsalted roasted nut butter with powdered sugar and a
little vanilla, form into pieces the size and shape of date stones
and put inside each date; roll in sugar or not, serve on grape or
maple leaves.</p>

<p>Serve with wafers, or with rolls and cereal coffee, sometimes.</p>

<p>Almond or Brazil nut butter may be used instead of peanut
butter, and rose or other flavoring. Grated cocoanut may be
mixed with the almond butter. Fill the dates with marshmallow
paste for Marshmallow Dates.</p>


<h3>Cream Stuffed Dates</h3>

<p>Make a roll the size of the stone of confection cream and insert
in date. The roll may be larger and allowed to show in the
opening.</p>


<h3>Stuffed Figs</h3>

<p>Stuff pulled figs by removing the inside and mixing it with
sweetened and flavored nut butter or with coarse chopped English
<a id="Page_489" class="pagenum" title="489"> </a>
walnuts, almonds and pecans, one or all, and replacing in
the skin.</p>

<p>Pile in the center of a dessert plate and surround with sticks
or beaten biscuit. Serve with or without cereal coffee.</p>


<h3>Stuffed Prunes</h3>

<p>Soak and steam choice, plump California prunes until tender,
cover close until cool, remove stones and fill space with a paste
made by kneading together almond butter, white of egg and
powdered or confectioner’s sugar.</p>


<h3>Sweetmeats&mdash;Fruits and Nuts</h3>

<p>1 part each Brazil nuts, almonds and hickory nuts or filberts
or English walnuts, and 1 or 2 parts raisins, figs or dates. Grind
fruit through finest cutter of mill and mix with nut butter or
meal or chopped nuts. Form into caramel shape, small rolls or
cones, or into a large roll and slice. Two or more of the sweet
fruits may be used, sometimes a little citron. Or, 3 parts
chopped hickory nut meats, 2 parts figs and other fruits.</p>


<h3>A Sweetmeat&mdash;Fruits</h3>

<p>1 lb. each of figs, from which the stems and hard part have
been cut, stoned dates and raisins; mix and grind through food
cutter; sprinkle board with confectioner’s sugar, knead mixture,
roll to ½ in. thick, cut into any desired shape and size and roll
in sugar.</p>


<h3>Kisses</h3>

<p>Whites of 6 eggs, 1 cup powdered sugar. Beat the whites
of eggs with a little salt, adding the sugar gradually while whipping
until the mixture is stiff enough to hold its shape; add flavoring
if desired and drop by spoonfuls on to paraffine paper laid
on boards of a size to fit the oven, or on baking tins. Dry in
warm oven for about an hour, then brown slightly. If the oven
is too warm, they may now be put into the warming oven or on
a shelf over the stove until thoroughly dried. If the kisses stick
to the paper, turn them over and moisten the paper slightly and
they will come off in a little while.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_490" class="pagenum" title="490"> </a>
Cocoanut Candy</h3>

<p>2 cups granulated sugar, ½ cup milk, 1 cup shredded cocoanut.
Boil sugar and milk together for 4 m., add cocoanut, flavor
to taste and cool in buttered tins.</p>


<h3>Candy Puffs</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 cups sugar</li>
  <li>1 cup water</li>
  <li>whites 2 eggs</li>
  <li>1 cup chopped nuts</li>
  <li>flavoring</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil sugar and water till they spin a heavy thread, then pour
the syrup over the stiffly-beaten whites of the eggs, stirring constantly.
When all the syrup is in, beat until the mass begins
to harden; add flavoring and nuts, mix thoroughly and place by
teaspoonfuls on buttered plates.</p>


<h3>Confection, or Bonbon Cream</h3>

<p>Beat the white of an egg to a stiff froth, add gradually 8 tablespns.
sifted powdered sugar, beat well together and flavor
with vanilla or any desired flavoring. Or, one half its bulk of
water may be added to the white of egg without beating, with
enough confectioner’s sugar to make stiff enough to mold into
balls. Different colors and flavorings may be used in cream.</p>


<h3>Nut Creams</h3>

<p>Halve English walnut or pecan meats and put confection cream
between the halves; press together and set away to harden.</p>


<h3>★ Confection Potatoes</h3>

<p>Add a little cocoanut to second confection cream, and form
into small potato shapes, making dents for eyes; roll in fine
powdered coriander or anise seed, or in brown sugar with a little
anise mixed with it.</p>


<h3>Marshmallows</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>4 oz. gum arabic</li>
  <li>1 cup water</li>
  <li>1¼ cup powdered sugar</li>
  <li>whites of 3 eggs</li>
  <li>2 teaspns. orange flower water or 1 of vanilla</li>
  <li>corn starch</li>
  <li>confectioner’s sugar</li>
</ul>

<p>Another recipe gives 2 cups powdered sugar and the white of
1 egg only, with the other ingredients.</p>

<p>Soak the gum arabic in the water until soft, strain into inner
<a id="Page_491" class="pagenum" title="491"> </a>
cup of double boiler, add sugar and cook, stirring until thick and
white. Try in ice water and when it will form a firm, not hard,
ball, remove from the fire and chop and beat in the stiffly-whipped
whites of the eggs with the flavoring. Turn the paste
into a shallow pan covered thick with corn starch, leaving it 1
inch in thickness. When cool or in about 12 hours, cut into
inch cubes, dust with confectioner’s sugar and pack in boxes.
Marshmallows are better to be made as soft as they can be
handled.</p>


<h3>Old Fashioned Molasses Candy</h3>

<p>2 cups molasses, 2 cups granulated sugar, 1 tablespn. butter.
Boil over not too hot fire until a little will harden as soon as it
drops into cold water. Pour into buttered tins and pull when cool
enough to handle. Candy may have hickory nut or black walnut
meats pressed into it when partly cooled, without pulling.</p>

<p>The most important thing for the candy is to get a good flavored
molasses. The real Porto Rico is best. Do not be induced
to add soda to the syrup. It spoils the rich golden color
which belongs to molasses candy, besides making it more unwholesome.
Brush the kettle with butter before putting ingredients
in.</p>


<h3>Everton Taffy</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>1 large cup New Orleans molasses</li>
  <li>1½ cup lightest brown sugar</li>
  <li>½ cup butter</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. vanilla</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil until a little dropped in water will make fine, brittle
threads; pour into buttered pans ¼&ndash;⅓ in. thick and cut in squares.</p>


<h3>Lemon Taffy&mdash;to pull</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 cups sugar</li>
  <li>1 cup water</li>
  <li>2 tablespns. lemon juice</li>
  <li>2 or 3 drops lemon extract</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil sugar and water until nearly done; add lemon juice and
cook until a little will harden in cold water; flavor and turn on
to buttered plate. Fold the edges toward the center as they
cool and pull as soon as cool enough to handle.</p>


<h3><a id="Page_492" class="pagenum" title="492"> </a>
Penosia</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>3 cups light brown sugar</li>
  <li>1 cup milk or cream</li>
  <li>1 tablespn. butter</li>
  <li>1 lb. English walnuts (1½ cup chopped)</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. vanilla</li>
</ul>

<p>Shell, blanch and chop the walnuts; boil sugar and milk until
syrup will harden when dropped into water but will not become
brittle; just before it is done, add the butter and vanilla; then
the chopped nuts, stirring them in well; pour into buttered pans
and with sharp knife mark off the squares. Cool.</p>

<p>Another recipe says dark brown sugar and ½ cup only of cream.</p>


<h3>Lozenges&mdash;Wintergreen or Peppermint</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
  <li>½ cup water</li>
  <li>4&ndash;6 drops true oil of wintergreen, or 3 drops oil of peppermint</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil sugar and water rapidly for 5 m. after they begin to boil,
add the flavoring and remove from the fire. Stir briskly until
the mixture begins to thicken and to have a whitish appearance,
then drop on to a cold tin dish, oiled paper or a marble slab as
fast as possible, in as large or small lozenges as desired. If the
mixture hardens too rapidly, set the dish in a pan of hot water.
Do not place the lozenges so close that they will run together.
The wintergreen drops may be tinted pink with fruit color.</p>


<h3>Maple Candy Cream</h3>

<ul class="ingredients">
  <li>3 cups grated maple sugar</li>
  <li>1 cup cream</li>
  <li>1 teaspn. butter</li>
</ul>

<p>Boil all together for 12 m., pour into another dish, stir until
mixture thickens, pour into buttered tins and cut in squares.</p>


<h3>Hoarhound Candy</h3>

<p>3 cups water, 2 oz. dried hoarhound, 3 lbs. (2¼ qts.) brown
sugar. Steep the dried herb in the water for a half hour; strain,
add the sugar and boil until a little will harden when dropped
in cold water; pour on to buttered tins and when sufficiently cool
cut into sticks with oiled knife.</p>

<p>“Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy

<p>“Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles,
and thy princes eat in due season, for strength and not for
drunkenness.” Eccl. 10:16, 17.</p>

<p>Many have been greatly benefited by eating the first meal,
breakfast, 3&ndash;5 hours after rising, according to their work.</p>

<p>“Eat only when hungry, drink only when thirsty.”&mdash;<i class="attribution">E.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;D.</i></p>

<p>“Three meals a day and nothing between meals, not even an
apple should be the utmost limit of indulgence. Those who go
further violate nature’s laws and will suffer the penalty.”</p>

<p>“If you would give it a trial, you would find two meals better
than three.”</p>

<p>“The stomach, when we lie down to rest, should have its
work all done, that it may enjoy rest as well as other portions
of the body. The work of digestion should not be carried on
through any period of the sleeping hours. If you feel that you
must eat at night, take a drink of cold water and in the morning
you will feel much better for not having eaten.”</p>

<p>“It is not well to eat fruit and vegetables at the same meal.
If the digestion is feeble, the use of both will often cause distress,
and inability to put forth mental effort. It is better to
have the fruit at one meal and the vegetables at another.”</p>

<p>As a rule, it is better to serve fruits at the close of a meal.</p>

<p>“In order to have healthy digestion, food should be eaten
slowly.... If your time to eat is limited, do not bolt your
food, but eat less and eat slowly.”</p>

<p>“Custom has decided that the food shall be placed upon the
table in courses. Not knowing what is coming next, one may
eat a sufficiency of food which perhaps is not the best suited to
him. When the last course is brought on he often ventures to
overstep the bounds and take the tempting dessert, which, however,
proves anything but good for him. If all the food intended
for<!--TN: was 'or'--> a meal is placed on the table at the beginning, one has opportunity
to make the best choice.”</p>

<p>For some time I have practised either putting the food all on
the table or having what was not on the table in sight on the
sideboard, or letting guests know in some way the full menu, as
I have always felt that while teaching temperance, we were
encouraging intemperance by the customary manner of serving.</p>

<p>When working hard, eat light; do not overwork the whole
body at the same time.</p>

<p>Perfect rest without sleep for 15&ndash;30 m. after meals is a great
aid to digestion.</p>

<p>“We should not provide for the Sabbath a more liberal supply
or a greater variety of food than for other days. Instead of
this, the food should be more simple and less should be eaten in<!--TN: deleted double 'in'-->
order that the mind may be clear and vigorous to comprehend
spiritual things. Overeating befogs the brain. The most precious
words may be heard and not appreciated because the mind
is confused by an improper diet.”</p>

<p>“Do not have too great a variety at a meal; three or four
dishes are a plenty. At the next meal you can have a change.
The cook should tax her inventive powers to vary the dishes
she prepares for the table, and the stomach should not be obliged
to take the same kinds of food meal after meal.”</p>

<p>Three or four dishes, each perfect of its kind, are more satisfying
<a id="Page_495" class="pagenum" title="495"> </a>
than a great number, not one of which is perfectly prepared
and served.</p>


<h3>MENUS</h3>

<p>The suggestive menus given will admit of variation according
to the season and circumstances.</p>

<p>Nut, olive or cooking oil with salt; nut butter of any kind; or
cream, may be used instead of dairy butter.</p>

<p>Macaroni baked in cream sauce left from dinner may be heated
and served for the next morning’s breakfast with the addition
of tomato or more milk.</p>

<p>Where the two pies are served for dessert, two small pieces
should be served on one plate. They introduce to the guests
two kinds of crust without lard, and mince pie without meat.</p>

<p>When a hearty soup or dessert are on the menu the other
dishes of the meal may be lighter.</p>

<p>Dainty dishes and spotless linen, will have much to do in fitting
for that city which has foundations of precious stones and
the paving of whose streets is gold.</p>

<p>These meals may be easily changed to sugarless as well as
starchless by substituting vegetables that contain no sugar for
those that have some, and tart fruits for sweet ones.</p>

<p>The custard may be made without sugar. Gluten biscuit used
as meat with fruit and vegetables give more of a variety, when
obtainable.</p>

<p>One may take large quantities of fruit in place of starchy foods,
since they are not so concentrated.</p>


<h3 id="PICNIC_AND_TRAVELLING_LUNCHES">PICNIC AND TRAVELLING LUNCHES</h3>

<p>Collect boxes of different sizes as you have opportunity.</p>

<p>Save waxed paper from cracker boxes and other sources and
have a certain place for it so as to know just where to find it.
Quite a large roll can be bought in the stationery stores for five
cents.</p>

<p>Keep small tin boxes for packing strong flavored sandwiches,
and vaseline bottles and cold cream jars for salad dressings, or for
sandwich fillings which must be spread upon the bread the last
thing.</p>

<p>For a picnic or a long journey, be sure to take everything that
may be needed, corkscrew, can opener, nut picks, paring knives,
spoons, a case knife, a knife large enough and sharp enough to
cut bread, cups for drinking, and a small saucepan or large cup
for heating drinks or anything necessary. As far as possible,
carry dishes that may be thrown away, as wood or paper plates
and cups. A spirit lamp is very desirable.</p>

<p><a id="Page_505" class="pagenum" title="505"> </a>
Rich cakes, jellies and all sweets are especially objectionable
for travelling.</p>

<p>Be sure to take plenty of lemons and other fruits, as the trains
will not often stop long enough for one to buy them at the stations,
and they may not be at the proper stage of ripeness and
the price will be high.</p>

<p>Carry salt in a vaseline bottle, or if in a salt shake, screw a
piece of thick paper under the top and wrap well. Have sugar
in a wide-mouthed bottle or jar, also ripe olives. Rice or custard
puddings can be carried in cups.</p>

<p>Bottled fruit juices are invaluable. Lemon juice sufficient
for one day may be bottled.</p>

<p>A jar of cold cereal coffee or of tea-hygiene with cream would
be highly prized by many.</p>

<p>Trumese in Tomato or Sauce Imperial, well dried in the oven,
is excellent. Fruit buns retain their moisture nicely.</p>

<p>Wrap sandwiches, buns, cakes, eggs and nut foods in waxed
paper, and if there are different kinds of sandwiches mark them.</p>

<p>For a simple luncheon without a knife or spoon, pare oranges
and break them into sections, and pare, quarter and core apples,
and wrap all in waxed paper. These fruits with a trumese and
egg sandwich (<a href="#Page_472">p.&nbsp;472</a>) make an ideal midday luncheon when
spending the day in the city on business.</p>

<p>One lady who has travelled a great deal tells me that she has
found a small white apron with a pocket a great convenience in
serving and eating lunches on trains, and a gentleman suggests
that a short apron with a bib and strap and a pocket for the
napkin would be a great convenience for those of his sex.</p>

<p>Some of the strong pasteboard boxes that package foods come
in, make good lunch boxes. We have one about 22 in. long,
9 in. wide and 6 in. deep that we can carry in a shawl strap,
which we prize.</p>

<p>The dining car has no attractions compared<!--TN: was 'campared'--> with the comforts
of a nice home luncheon for travelling.</p>
